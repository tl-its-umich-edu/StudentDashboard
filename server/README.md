This implements a simple REST ruby web server based on sinatra. 
It expects to return data in json format.

The url format is:
http://localhost:3000/courses/jabba.json

Jabba is the user name.  The data currently is fake.

The ./runServer.sh script in this directory will start up a
development server on localhost port 3000 to exercise the SD back
end.

NOTE: errors in the ruby may be much easier to find if run with
"bundle exec rackup -p 3000" instead of runServer.sh or guard.
