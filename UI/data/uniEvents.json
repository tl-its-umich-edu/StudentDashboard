Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

When her family moved to Germany during her teens, she added languages, philosophy, and poetry to her studies. On her return to the United States, Liz continued her formal piano studies at the Juilliard School of Music and also enrolled at Hunter College. After hearing the jazz pianist Bill Evans one night at the Bottom Line in New York City, she decided to learn jazz piano\u2013and after moving back to Southern California and taking a job playing piano in a restaurant, she was suddenly thrust into improvisations when she discovered that the piano she was to perform on had no stand for her sheet music. Over several months, these improvisations developed into compositions. When Will Ackerman, founder of the influential Windham Hill label, heard a tape of those, he signed her to record her 1983 debut album \u201cSolid Colors.\" Liz has since released a dozen albums that havehighlighted her classical piano background, fused with a wide range of styles embracing jazz, folk, pop, and impressionistic music. An evening with Liz Story is meditative, spiritual, even profound, and we're excited to welcome her back to The Ark for the first time in many years.",

This five-piece ensemble comes from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Moving from bluesy riffs to tango-inflected jazz, to a raunchy New Orleans jamboree vibe, their music always returns to a wonderfully bouncy traditional sound. They themselves call their music \"trad on anabolic steroids.\" With a repertoire of fresh self-penned tunes and inventive arrangements, Beoga's album \"A Lovely Madness\" earned a 9\/10 rating from Ireland\u2019s Hot Press magazine, and all their albums have landed on numerous ten-best lists in both Ireland and North America. Says the Irish Echo: \"It is Beoga who may be Ireland\u2019s closest answer to The Band in combined virtuosity, risk-taking, and omnivorous musical palate.\"",

        "description":"When the sun leaves the sky, Darlene Yeager-Torre gathers flashlights, camera and tripod and ventures into the night to create luminous landscape photographs by using extremely long exposures (45 seconds to 1 hour). After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

Paramodel works in a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, video, and photography, often combining pieces in site-specific installations that seek to construct a parallel world of \u201cplay\u201d\u009d intersecting with the real world. For UMMA\u2019s exhibition, Paramodelwill create a new installation derived from their most famous series, paramodelic-graffiti. In a mesmerizing network of blue-colored model railroads that fill flat surfaces in and beyond the gallery, the installation will transgress the boundaries of space, media, and art production, collapsing the distinction between gallery and street; between two-dimensional drawing and three-dimensional object; and between creator and spectator. The exhibition will create an experience for visitors full of what the team calls \u201cparadoxes.\u201d\u009d\r\n\r\nThough they\u2019ve shown extensively in Asia and Europe over the past ten years, this marks Paramodel\u2019s first solo exhibition of work in the United States. The collaborativerecently presented a solo exhibition at the Herm\u00e8s Foundation in Paris.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"The art of Primitive Americana comes naturally to Sandra Somers who was born and raised in a small midwestern town \"full of large old houses, horse barns and lush farmland within roller skating range.\" Her primitive art, created using acrylics, depicts an active, bustling world with interesting architecture that time has somehow overlooked. Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

        "description":"On April 29th, The Chris Robinson Brotherhood returns from gathering the ineffable with \"Phosphorescent Harvest,\" their third long-playing album for Silver Arrow Records. Having first unshackled the air with \"Big Moon Ritual\" and \"The Magic Door,\" the band\u2013Robinson (Lead vocals, guitar), Neal Casal (guitar, vocals), Adam Macdougall (keys, vocals), George Sluppick (drums), and Mark Dutton (bass, vocals)\u2013trucked the realms relentlessly, including a 118-show stretch that never failed to illuminate blank nights to just this side of clarity. Late 2013 saw the fruits of that labor forever captured in the proverbial amber by legendary tape priestess, Betty Cantor-Jackson (Grateful Dead), on the eight-sided limited-edition vinyl release \"Betty\u2019s S.F. Blends Volume 1,\" which documented a glorious five night run at San Francisco\u2019s famed Great American Music Hall. \r\n\r\nMomentarily content with dusting the globe and turning the sun out at its scattered dances, the Brotherhood reconvened with producer Thom Monahan (Vetiver, Devendra Banhart, Papercuts) to materialize a new set of sounds unseen to lean on ceilings, a music of the spheres not content to just envelop rafters. The writing partnership and dialogue between Robinson and Casal has never been as closely woven as it is on \"Phosphorescent Harvest,\" almost akin to the conversation you hear murmuring out of the mouths of the moon and the stars as they glide the celestial track. This isn\u2019t a range they ride alone though, and as strong as the songwriting gets does too the rest of the band\u2019s willingness to seek company in chaos\u2019 warm embrace, discovering that in familiar forms there can glow a vastness. \r\n\r\n\"Phosphorescent Harvest\" features ten new songs that build on the California group\u2019s impressively growing repertoire by combining the direct and immediate songwriting Robinson has long been known for with an expansive sense of space and texture that has never been so fully realized until now. In an age when so many put their beliefs in trends, the volumes have all collapsed and rooms are filled with tiny rock and dampened lamps, the Chris Robinson Brotherhood rolls on to sharpen the blur at your brow and wind like smoke through your mind.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

        "description":"Decolonization is justly claimed as an axial event of the twentieth century. From this vantage, India\u2019s place in social science resided in its relatively early achievement of the status of a nation-state and its illustration of the dilemmas of a conjoined commitment to democracy and development. A range of empirical and theoretical developments in the last few decades has now converged to transform India from an object of received social science to an instigator of new cross-disciplinary approaches. This project builds upon and extends this shift by rethinking conceptions of the political and of the twentieth century in relation to India.\r\n\r\nThe two-day workshop at Michigan is the second to emerge out of this project. The first workshop was held in New Delhi on January 10 & 11, 2014 with a focus on India's political imaginaries. The Michigan workshop assembles an international group of scholars to rethink India\u2019s democratic politics in the concrete political landscapes of late-colonial and postcolonial India.  Scholarly evaluations of India\u2019s democracy have been as contentious as the phenomenon in question. The purpose of the workshop is neither to adjudicate existing disciplinary debates or definitions of democracy as such nor to offer yet another normative evaluation. It is rather to foster a consideration of India\u2019s democracy as a trans-disciplinary object, paying attention to its long-run making across distinct practices, infrastructures (institutions and concepts), and conjunctures.\r\n\r\nMrinalini Sinha, Alice Freeman Palmer Professor of History, University of Michigan\r\nManu Goswami, Associate Professor of History, New York University\r\n\r\nThis conference has been generously funded by Ranvir and Adarsh Trehan and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.\r\n\r\nFor complete conference information--including the program and participant list--click on the \"Web and Social\" link below.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

She plays enough instruments to be called a one-woman string band: mandolin, clawhammer banjo, and guitar, for starters. She sings in supple tones that blur the folk-pop boundary, and she writes songs that range from dead ringers for old-time ballads to lyrically rich singer-songwriter reflections. Raised near Austin, Sarah signed with the Sugar Hill label when she was a senior in high school. She has studied at the New England Conservatory, been nominated for a Grammy, and performed on \"Austin City Limits\" and \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and at the likes of the Bonnaroo, Telluride, and Newport music festivals. Sarah's fine new album, \"Build Me Up from Bones,\" has just been nominated for a 2014 Americana music award.",

        "description":"Decolonization is justly claimed as an axial event of the twentieth century. From this vantage, India\u2019s place in social science resided in its relatively early achievement of the status of a nation-state and its illustration of the dilemmas of a conjoined commitment to democracy and development. A range of empirical and theoretical developments in the last few decades has now converged to transform India from an object of received social science to an instigator of new cross-disciplinary approaches. This project builds upon and extends this shift by rethinking conceptions of the political and of the twentieth century in relation to India.\r\n\r\nThe two-day workshop at Michigan is the second to emerge out of this project. The first workshop was held in New Delhi on January 10 & 11, 2014 with a focus on India's political imaginaries. The Michigan workshop assembles an international group of scholars to rethink India\u2019s democratic politics in the concrete political landscapes of late-colonial and postcolonial India.  Scholarly evaluations of India\u2019s democracy have been as contentious as the phenomenon in question. The purpose of the workshop is neither to adjudicate existing disciplinary debates or definitions of democracy as such nor to offer yet another normative evaluation. It is rather to foster a consideration of India\u2019s democracy as a trans-disciplinary object, paying attention to its long-run making across distinct practices, infrastructures (institutions and concepts), and conjunctures.\r\n\r\nMrinalini Sinha, Alice Freeman Palmer Professor of History, University of Michigan\r\nManu Goswami, Associate Professor of History, New York University\r\n\r\nThis conference has been generously funded by Ranvir and Adarsh Trehan and the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts.\r\n\r\nFor complete conference information--including the program and participant list--click on the \"Web and Social\" link below.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

After growing up on a potato farm in northern Maine, Ellis started writing songs while he was attending Boston College on a track scholarship and was laid up for several months with an injury. He's often called the quintessential New England songwriter, and he's got a baker's dozen of Boston Music Awards to prove it. Ellis's passionate, literate character sketches, delivered in a soaring, lyrical voice, have influenced a generation of folksters toward the shamelessly poetic. The Boston Globe calls Ellis \"literate, provocative, urbanely romantic.\" Whatever you call him, he's one of the major songwriters of our time. He comes to Michigan with a new release, \"Chasing Beauty.\"",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Everybody has a story about this folk legend, and some of the stories are myths. The truth is that Ramblin' Jack has not only taught but also learned something from everyone he's ever met and made music with. Ramblin' Jack's career has crossed paths with musicians ranging from the singing cowboys he worked with after running away from home in New York, to Woody Guthrie (much of whose music he transmitted to the world), to Arlo Guthrie, Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, and Tom Russell, all of whom he mentored or directly influenced. Ramblin' Jack Elliott is a true American treasure whose recent recording work on the Anti- label has brought him a new group of fans who are two or three generations younger than he is. His latest release, \"A Stranger Here,\" won a Grammy for Best Traditional Blues Album.",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Chris achieved extraordinary goals despite impossible odds and left behind a philosophy of life for all of us to follow. GO FAR is a motivational film that will inspire not only persons with disabilities, but everyone, to follow their dreams and achieve them, no matter the obstacles. Featuring Tony Orlando, Jerry Lewis, and narrated by Mark Hamill.\u2028\u2028 \r\n\r\nShortly before his death Chris invented a program called GO FAR, a motivational program that he intended to promote by traveling the world and inspiring those in need. This film's purpose is to be used as a tool to promote Chris\u2019 message and continue his goal of promoting the GO FAR philosophy. Chris\u2019 memoirs state \u201cI think it\u2019s true that we all serve a purpose in life and I\u2019ve always accepted my own as being one of a messenger. It became my mission to teach others--that no matter the obstacles in front of them--they too can GO FAR.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis presentation is part of the U-M Services for Students with Disabilities 40th Anniversary.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

He has been involved in local theater for 35 years. He has an MA from the University of Michigan.",

An avowed admirer of the painter, Hitler endeavored to amass a significant collection of Rembrandts for the museum he planned in Linz. There was a major problem with the artist, however, that posed difficulties for the Nazis. In order to conform to Nazi ideologies of race, Rembrandt was either purged of his supposed \"Jewishness,\" or denigrated for it. This talk investigates the ambivalence surrounding the artist during the Third Reich by consulting such Nazi art critics as Maria Grunewald, Hans Frank, Walter Hansen, and Alfred Rosenberg (the latter, editor of the newspaper, V\u00c3\u00b6lkischer Beobachter), who variously denounced or \"aryanized\" Rembrandt. Also pertinent to this discussion are interpretations of Rembrandt's art by such German critics as Julius Langbehn, Carl Neumann, Wilhelm Valentiner (director of the Detroit Institute of Arts), and the famous author, Anna Seghers.",

Formed in Boulder at the end of 1989, the Colorado slamgrass pioneers took their form of aggressive bluegrass to rock and roll bars at a time when it wasn't so common, helping Leftover Salmon become a pillar of the jam band scene and unwitting architects of the jam grass genre. Today, Leftover Salmon is: Vince Herman (vocals, acoustic guitar, washboard); Drew Emmitt (vocals, acoustic and electric mandolin, electric guitar, fiddle); Andy Thorn (vocals, acoustic and electric banjo); Greg Garrison (vocals, acoustic and electric bass); and Alwyn Robinson (drums). NPR\u2019s Mountain Stage heralded Colorado\u2019s Leftover Salmon as \u201cone of the most beloved acts on America's summer-festival circuit.\u201d\u009d After changes and a hiatus, Leftover Salmon is officially back. \u201cThe time is right for this band to come back on a lot of levels\u201d\u009d says Drew Emmitt. \u201cIt\u2019s taken us a little while, but I think we\u2019re finally there.\"\r\n",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"Pan Gongkai\u2019s Melt (\u6f58\u516c\u51ef\uff1a\u878d) is a large-scale video installation that is concerned with the relationship between Chinese and Western art forms. Projected on the screen are images of withered lotuses gradually being covered by snow. The lotuses are derived from one of Pan\u2019s large ink paintings, while the snow is itself composed with the words from the artist\u2019s theoretical text, \u201cOn the Boundary of Western Modern Art.\u201d The composition reflects Pan\u2019s concern for the ways in which modern Western art has imposed itself upon traditional Chinese culture. Here, the withered lotuses can be seen as representing traditional Chinese literati culture, while the snow can be understood as part of a forced dialogue with the West. Although the snow might be viewed as threatening to blot out China\u2019s artistic traditions, it can also be seen as the element of its regeneration. After all, it is this same snow that, when melted, nourishes future blossoms. Melt was featured at the Chinese Pavilion of 54th Venice Biennale (2011).\r\n\r\nProfessor Joseph Tanke has argued that Snow Melt should be understood according to a paradoxical logic whereby the work performs its own contemporaneity by diagnosing and then refusing the teleological logic of contemporary Western art. As such, it allows for a frank consideration of the procedures of inclusion and exclusion upon which the notion of contemporary art is premised. According to Tanke, Pan Gongkai has incorporated the limits of Western art into his work, while simultaneously refusing to participate in its dominant logic of transgression. This gesture, whereby the limit of Western art is incorporated without being transgressed, produces the heat that causes the snow to melt, thereby releasing new forms of artistic and historical intelligibility. Pan\u2019s gesture may thus allow viewers to recognize that one of the most traditional artistic forms can turn out to be the most contemporary. \r\n\r\nA renowned artist, theoretician and educator, Pan Gongkai is a strong proponent of the Chinese ink painting tradition. His large ink paintings retain essential elements of traditional literati painting enhanced with modern aesthetics. In this way, his work exemplifies a modern synthesis of traditional ink and wash painting. Critically acclaimed, Pan\u2019s ink paintings and installations works have been exhibited at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, Venice Biennale, ZKM in Germany and major art museums in New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macao. He is the author of History of Painting in China, Limit and Exploration, Analysis of Pan Tianshou\u2019s Painting Skill and On Pan Tianshou\u2019s Life and Art. In recent years, Pan has dedicated himself to comprehensive research on modern Chinese art, and his recent publication The Road of Chinese Modern Art has made a significant impact on the liberal arts in China. Pan currently serves as the president of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"When the sun leaves the sky, Darlene Yeager-Torre gathers flashlights, camera and tripod and ventures into the night to create luminous landscape photographs by using extremely long exposures (45 seconds to 1 hour). After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Bruce Arntson and Jenny Littleton wield the vocals of vintage country stars and the acting chops of Broadway veterans, taking audiences on a freewheeling joyride through a wickedly funny script and slew of equally hilarious original songs. Over the past two years, this \"brilliantly tacky tribute to Music City\" (Nashville City Paper) has developed a rabid cult following in Nashville, with many people seeing the show over a dozen times. Someone once said that we only satirize what we love most, and Doyle and Debbie, who've become a Tuesday-night fixture at Nashville's legendary Station Inn, offer the latest and most fun chapter in a long history of self-satire in country music.",

        "description":"When the sun leaves the sky, Darlene Yeager-Torre gathers flashlights, camera and tripod and ventures into the night to create luminous landscape photographs by using extremely long exposures (45 seconds to 1 hour). After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium.

Surprisingly little scholarship has addressed the details of this exchange, asking what Europeans absorbed from the musical practices of the Holy Land and what musical traditions they may have left behind. In this lecture, eminent ethnomusicologist Dwight Reynolds addresses the question of musical influence and exchange in the eastern Mediterranean during the era of the Crusades.\r\n\r\nDwight F. Reynolds is professor of Arabic language and literature in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of Heroic Poets, Poetic Heroes: The Ethnography of Performance in an Egyptian Oral Epic Tradition (1995) and Arab Folklore (2007), co-author and editor of Interpreting the Self: Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition  (2001), and co-editor of The Garland Encyclopedia of Word Music: The Middle East (2002). He has published numerous articles on Arabo-Andalusian music and has conducted research on these traditions in Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

        "description":"\u201cWorld music\u201d, which appeared in the West in the 1980s as a marketing\/classificatory device of the music industry, usually refers to non-Western music or fusion of Western and non-Western music. The all-inclusive concept becomes even more ambiguous when it is adopted into the Chinese language. However, more and more Chinese musicians are making use of the term to promote their music to a wider audience, both nationally and internationally. Ethnic minority musicians find this new market of \u201cworld music\u201d useful to sell their marginalized music. Han Chinese musicians are also inspired by \u201cworld music\u201d to draw from their traditions and mix it with other music languages. For the Shanghai government, \u201cworld music\u201d is in accordance with its imaging of the city\u2019s position as an international metropolis. Thus it sponsored the World Music Shanghai, China\u2019s first world music festival, as one of the events to celebrate the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. A number of other world music festivals have been born in China since then, often with the sponsorship of real estate companies, who do so to promote their brands. What does \u201cworld music\u201d mean in the Chinese context?\r\n\r\nMr. Mu Qian is a Chinese performing arts curator, ethnomusicologist, and writer. He received his M.A. in Ethnomusicology from the China Conservatory in 2005, and B.A. in English Language and Literature from Nanjing University in 1997.Mu has served as Music Director of World Music Shanghai and MOMA Post Mountain Music-Art Festival in Beijing, two festivals dedicated to introducing music from around the world to the Chinese audience as well as presenting Chinese music with a global perspective. Mu has recently received a fellowship of the Asian Cultural Council to do research on world music and observe arts administration practices in Washington D.C. and New York from March to October 2014.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Its members came from different part of the globe, bringing together their many cultural influences to forge a unique blend of traditional Irish music that literally had them, months after they formed, playing in major festivals in Ireland, Belgium, France, England, Denmark, and Holland. When you hear Comas you'll know that their choice of name was no accident: it translates from Irish Gaelic as \"Power,\" and power is exactly what this band is about. It describes their own driving power coupled with a fine sensitivity for the inner strands of magic that is inherent in Irish music. Comas is a band firmly rooted in Irish music, but with enough space to allow for original compositions. Their openness to new influences and a respectful eye on the past bring Comas to the forefront of what traditional music is about today. Comas comes to Michigan with a new release, the aptly named \"Charge!\"",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

She received her undergraduate degree from Osaka University of the Arts in piano performance and a master\u2019s degree in composition from Tokyo College of Music.  In 1994 she received a scholarship from the Asian Culture Council to study the Navajo language and the music of the Navajo and the Hopi in Arizona.  Following this study, she returned to the performance of Heian period chant and shirabyoshi dance in its unaccompanied form.  Ms. Sakurai has adapted shomyo for contemporary settings, collaborated with Japanese and American composers, and written several original noh dramas, including Manhattan Okina (first performed 2007), Pirate Princess (2009), and Minister of the Bank (2014).\r\n\r\nAbstract: Shomyo is a chant used in Japanese esoteric Buddhist services.  This talk will introduce shomyo in the Tendai sect.  Tendai shomyo was brought to Japan from China by the monk Ennin (794-864).  Initially, during the Heian period (8th-12th centuries CE), the monks chanted the poetic parts of sutra text in Chinese or Sanskrit.  Later, monks began to chant the translated Japanese text.  A Buddhist service conducted in translated Japanese is called renji, and the part of renji that is sung is called shirabyoshi.  Later the word shirabyoshi came to refer also to female performers who sung Buddhist and Chinese literary texts.  These performers also danced.  This talk will introduce shomyo and shirabyoshi and discuss their transformation over time.\r\n\r\nCosponsored by the Center for World Performance Studies, the Confucius Institute at the University of Michigan, the Department of Musicology, and the Kenneth G. Lieberthal and Richard H. Rogel Center for Chinese Studies.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

She received her undergraduate degree from Osaka University of the Arts in piano performance and a master\u2019s degree in composition from Tokyo College of Music. In 1994 she received a scholarship from the Asian Culture Council to study the Navajo language and the music of the Navajo and the Hopi in Arizona. Following this study, she returned to the performance of Heian period chant and shirabyoshi dance in its unaccompanied form. Ms. Sakurai has adapted shomyo for contemporary settings, collaborated with Japanese and American composers, and written several original noh dramas, including Manhattan Okina (first performed 2007), Pirate Princess (2009), and Minister of the Bank (2014).\r\n\r\nAbstract: Shomyo is a chant used in Japanese esoteric Buddhist services. Tendai shomyo (shomyo in the Tendai sect) was brought to Japan from China by the monk Ennin (794-864). Initially, during the Heian period (8th-12th centuries CE), the monks chanted the poetic parts of sutra text in Chinese or Sanskrit. Later, monks began to chant the translated Japanese text. A Buddhist service conducted in translated Japanese is called renji, and the part of renji that is sung is called shirabyoshi. Later the word shirabyoshi came to refer also to female performers who sung Buddhist and Chinese literary texts. These performers also danced. \r\n\r\nAt this special event, Ms. Sakurai will perform 5 pieces of shomyo and 3 pieces of shirabyoshi. A Q&A session will follow the performance.\r\n\r\nCosponsored by the Center for World Performance Studies, the Confucius Institute at the University of Michigan, the Department of Musicology, and the Kenneth G. Lieberthal and Richard H. Rogel Center for Chinese Studies.",

It is as if the viewer has stopped by the trail and is quietly contemplating the patterns of light and color in the woods. The porcelains are functional, making enjoying them even more rewarding. Kendall has a Master's degree in Fine Art from Illinois State University and was director of the Art School, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts for many years. His studio, Oak Leaf Pottery, is in the country near Plainwell, Michigan. Kendall's work has been exhibited widely and is in collections in the US and abroad.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

As a teenager she absorbed the country music of Loretta Lynn, Merle Haggard, and Johnny Cash, as well as the folk classics of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Her 1992 debut album, \"Infamous Angel,\" distilled these influences into a poetic yet down-to-earth songwriting style. With a heartfelt, homespun voice that listeners recognize instantly, Iris released some of the most powerful roots albums of the 1990s with the beautifully sparse \"My Life\" and the harder-edged \"The Way I Should.\" In 2012, after a long creative silence, Iris returned with \"Sing the Delta,\" which the Boston Globe called \"a work of rare, unvarnished grace and power.\"",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

It is as if the viewer has stopped by the trail and is quietly contemplating the patterns of light and color in the woods. The porcelains are functional, making enjoying them even more rewarding. Kendall has a Master's degree in Fine Art from Illinois State University and was director of the Art School, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts for many years. His studio, Oak Leaf Pottery, is in the country near Plainwell, Michigan. Kendall's work has been exhibited widely and is in collections in the US and abroad.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

Played with wry humanity by writer-director Aktan Arym Kubat, the trusting Mr. Light strikes a suspect bargain with a rich developer running for local office, as unemployment threatens the survival of the community. Stoking a dream to supply wind-generated electricity to the whole valley, the modest visionary comes up against an increasingly dark cloud of corruption in this affecting tale of solidarity and ordinary decency amid the injustices and hardships of a changing world.",

In short order they opened for blues greats like Buddy Guy, Luther Allison, Son Seals, and Taj Mahal and toured the Netherlands. At the University of Michigan, Laith was a member of the Johnny Trudell Orchestra and freelanced with Detroit greats like Thornetta Davis, Jocelyn B, The Reefermen. Laith is a real road warrior who generally can be found playing at least five nights a week around Michigan and beyond.He has opened for artists like Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Leon Russell, Robben Ford, Johnny Winter, Hubert Sumlin, Olu Dara, Ten Years After, Mountain, The Yardbirds and\u2014most notably\u2014B.B. King at the House of Blues in Chicago. Laith has released three albums; his latest, \"Real,\" was recorded with an all-star cast of L.A. session legends including Tom Scott on sax, Jim Keltner on drums, and Leland Sklar on bass. The soulful new album harkens back to the great musical traditions of New Orleans and Chicago with a splash of blues, country, gospel, and roots rock, and it's arguably Laith's best work to date.",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"In this lecture Professor Abu-Lughod will reflect on two unanticipated aspects of the passionate and polarized after-life of her attempt to intervene in debates about Muslim women and their rights, through her book \"Do Muslim Women Need Saving?\" She explains, \u201cAlthough my intention was to present alternatives to the highly mediated, and institutionalized public production of what miriam cooke has called \u201cthe Muslimwoman,\u201d first by subjecting the debates to ethnographic scrutiny and second by offering alternative frameworks drawn from long-term fieldwork in Egypt, the work was received unevenly by diverse publics.  Responses ranged from near-silence from the target public to discomfiting anger from a Palestinian hip hop group with a feminist song on the one hand to touching personal affirmations from marginalized counter-publics of Muslim women in the West on the other.  Marilyn Strathern long ago pointed to the awkwardness of the relationship between anthropology and feminism. This awkwardness may have intensified as feminism has gone transnational and aligned itself with human rights and humanitarianism.\u201d\r\n\r\nLila Abu-Lughod, Joseph L. Buttenwieser Professor of Social Science, directs the Middle East Institute and teaches anthropology and gender studies at Columbia University. She is a former director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender and also of the Center for the Study of Social Difference.\r\n\r\nPresented by the Institute for Research on Women & Gender (IRWG).\r\n\r\nCosponsors: Anthropology, Arab American Studies, Near Eastern Studies, University Library.",

With the release of her fourth album, \"Mischievous Moon,\" a stunning concoction that features Barber\u2019s unmistakable contralto backed by sweeping strings and dramatic orchestration, Jill Barber\u2019s evolution to confident chanteuse is complete. Inspired by the great ladies of song like Ella Fitzgerald and Edith Piaf, Jill charms her audiences while weaving a romantic spell. Indeed, romance plays a huge role in both her life and her art. Her album \"Chances\" represented \"the courtship phase of my career,\" she muses. \u201cWith 'Mischievous Moon,' we\u2019re getting intimate. The romance is alive and well, but there\u2019s something deeper to be uncovered.\u201d",

        "description":"Speaker: Joseph Lam, Director of the Confucius Institute at U-M, Professor of Musicology, University of Michigan\r\n\r\nTraditional China pairs up music (yue) and eroticism to inform on one another, generating many operatic shows and debates about its performance arts and gender relationships. A representative and entertaining one is, for example, the kunqu (classical Chinese opera) play entitled \"Captured Alive,\" a drama that tells the ghost of Yan Poxi strangling Zhang Sanlang, her human lover, and taking him to hell to resume their illicit love affair. Critical analyses of the play underscore that kunqu performances multivalently portray Chinese men's desire for and anxiety about musically talented and sexually appealing women.\r\n\r\nJoseph Lam is Director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Michigan and Professor of Musicology, the School of Music, Theatre and Dance, the University of Michigan. A musicologist and sinologist, Lam specializes in the musics and cultures of Southern Song (1127-1275), Ming (1368-1644), and modern China (1900 to present). Lam regularly lectures in the U.S., Mainland China, and Asia. His most recent publications include: \u201cMusic and Masculinities in Ming China\u201d (Asian Music, 2011), and Songdai yinyueshi lunwenji: lilun yu miaoshu\/ Historical Studies on Song Dynasty Music: Theories and Narratives (Shanghai: Shanghai Conservatory of Music Press, 2012). Currently, he is working on a monograph entitled: \u201cKunqu, the Classical Opera of Globalized China.\u201d",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"Cas Mudde, associate professor of international affairs, University of Georgia\r\n\r\nAccording to the international media, the European Union was shaken by a \u201cpolitical earthquake\u201d in May 2014. The source of that earthquake was the electoral success of so-called \u201canti-EU parties\u201d in general, and far Right parties in particular. But while it is true that unprecedented results were obtained by some far Right parties, much of what happened was either not new or not noticed. This lecture will look at the results of the far Right in a broad historic and regional perspective, arguing that the shocks were largely local and predictable, and will have relatively limited national and supranational consequences, at least in the short and medium term.\r\n\r\nCas Mudde is an associate professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia. He earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in political science at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Professor Mudde is an expert on European politics and the foremost scholar on the far right in western democracies. He has published widely on topics such as (un)civil society, democratization, Euroskepticism, extremism and democracy, political parties, and populism. His most recent book publications include the four-volume reader Political Extremism (SAGE, 2013) and the co-edited Populism in Europe and the Americas: Threat or Corrective for Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2012). His book Populist Radical Right Parties in Europe (Cambridge University Press, 2007) won the Stein Rokkan Prize and was named an Outstanding Academic Title by Choice. Professor Mudde is regularly consulted on issues of extremism and democracy by state and non-state organizations, and often contributes quotes and op-eds to the national and international media.",

        "description":"his lecture traces the intellectual journey of an aspiring Jewish scholar from modest beginnings in the former Pale of Settlement to a leading position in the academic world of Leningrad. Born to a religiously observant family in a shtetl, Isaiah Mendeleevich Pul\u2019ner would go on to become a prominent ethnographer of Soviet Jewish populations, and director of the Jewish Section of the State Museum of Ethnography in Leningrad from 1937 to 1942. As a museum curator, he promoted a Marxist-Leninist vision of Jews as purely secular members of a socialist \u201cfamily of nations.\u201d\u009d Unpublished archival documents, however, suggest that Pul\u2019ner retained some connections with the traditional Judaism of his youth. These materials indicate that he was strongly influenced by the pre-revolutionary ethnographer Sh. An-sky, and was deeply concerned with salvaging artifacts of traditional Judaism. Pul'ner's ambitious research plans for the Jewish Section were cut short by the outbreak of World War II and his untimely death during the Siege of Leningrad. By tracing Pul'ner's career in its totality, this presentation considers the complexities that drove Pul\u2019ner\u2019s ethnographic agenda, asking if his primary devotion was to the state, or to the folk.",

        "description":"On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was murdered in front of hundreds of onlookers. Everything was over in mere seconds, but the events of that day have been the subject of heated debate for five decades.  The presidential commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson was headed by then-Chief Justice Earl Warren. Tasked with determining the truth, the Warren Commission investigated the Kennedy assassination and published its report the following year. September 2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the release of the Warren Commission findings.  \r\n\r\nNow, in this eye-opening new account of the Commission and its findings, Howard P. Willens sets out to prove that Warren's advice was prescient. Willens, the only living member of the three-person supervisory staff of the Warren Commission, supervised the investigation from the very beginning and has waited until now to silence the critics and well-intentioned armchair detectives.  Drawn from Willens' own journals and extensive notes on the investigation--which have never before been published--History Will Prove Us Right tells the true and complete story, perhaps for the first time, of every aspect of the investigation into one of the century's most harrowing events from a uniquely first-person perspective.\r\n\r\nOpen Seating; Free Admission; Free Parking; Book sales\/signing and reception follow program.",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

        "description":"Krisztina Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ry, associate professor of anthropology, U-M\r\n\r\nDrawing on the arguments from her recent book, Politics in Color and Concrete (2013), Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ry will discuss the relationship of architecture and home furnishing to political sentiments in Hungary over the past half century. This account centers on the role of the concrete block apartment buildings that came to dominate the landscape throughout state-socialist eastern Europe and the aesthetic styles that emerged in opposition to it. Discontent with the state socialist regime became inseparable from discontent with its modernist housing forms, and a shared \u201corganicist\u201d aesthetic emerged in the way families furnished their homes inside these rectilinear buildings. This organicist aesthetic included an affection for natural materials as well as \u201cfolk\u201d artifacts, weathered by time or crafted with traditional methods. But far from being aligned with a backwards-looking nationalism, the style united elements of peasant artisanal traditions with the informality and open qualities of modern design.\r\n\r\nAfter the regime change of 1989, the \u201cfolk\u201d elements of this style became intensely politicized by state nationalism. A professionally-designed \u201corganicist architecture\u201d became the symbol of the newly independent nation-state and the only architectural style appropriate for new churches. Organicist d\u00e9cor, meanwhile, was transformed from do-it-yourself production into upscale commodities purchased by the emerging middle classes. On the one hand, this organicist aesthetic has encompassed divergent political orientations, including populist right, a neoliberal left, and environmentalist alternatives. On the other, the continuing attachments to such organicism contribute powerful constraints on the kinds of politics possible in Hungary today.\r\n\r\nKrisztina Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1ry, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan, received her Ph.D. from The University of Chicago. She is the author of Politics in Color and Concrete: Socialist Materialities and the Middle Classes (Indiana University Press, 2013). Her work on materiality, consumer culture, aesthetics, popular culture and socio-historical transformation, especially in socialist\/post-socialist eastern Europe, has been published in journals such as Cultural Anthropology, Comparative Studies in Society and History, Social Identities, Ethnos and City and Society.",

        "description":"Can music be analyzed rigorously and studied linguistically? This presentation demonstrates that, whilst music as a sensory-perceptual experience cannot be analyzed via linguistic means, aesthetic and cultural concepts written about music can. In Western music, composers have generally continued the tradition of \u201cdescribing\u201d how their works should be performed, engaging in the use of musical terms such as affettuoso (\u2018tenderly\u2019 in Italian), etc. Chinese musical concepts present a compelling focal point of study since many have been in use for several millennia. These concepts not only provide a window through which to tap into Chinese music, they are also \u201ccultural key words\u2026which reflect the core values\u201d of Chinese culture (following Wierzbicka 1991: 333). As our linguistic tool for analysis, this study adopts the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, as advanced by Wierzbicka and Goddard. Analyzed meanings of selected Chinese musical concepts illustrate how, why and in what respects these concepts attest to important aesthetic and cultural values in Chinese.\r\n\r\nAdrian Tien is an assistant professor in the Department of Chinese Studies, National University of Singapore. His teaching and research interests include linguistics, specializing in the areas of semantics, language and culture, cross-cultural communication, language acquisition, translation and language and music. Dr. Tien is also trained as a musicologist and is a sought-after musician (pianist and carillonneur), being a prizewinner of several international music competitions. \r\n\r\nThis talk is part of CIUM's Chinese Arts and Culture Festival from September 24 to September 27, 2014.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"Storyman is the songwriting partnership of Kevin May and Mick Lynch. Former members of The Guggenheim Grotto, Kevin May and Mick Lynch realized early on when faced with the concept of career that they had only one choice: Art. Their art of choice was music. They set out developing their multi-instrumental sound to support what has become one of the most unique, identifiable and chilling vocal marriages. It\u2019s not by chance that they have been compared over the years to the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel with a dash of Leonard Cohen and a few drops of Radiohead\u2013add some of Ireland\u2019s most poignant crooners and you might have a hint of their pedigree. Most recently they have been likened to Bon Iver and Fleet Foxes, but they always remain outside the trends of the day retaining an aura of permanence along with deep wisdom. Yes, they were born and bred Irish lads, but their music has always been universal with a signature debt to Irish melancholy, the sad sweet fragrance and elixir of pain that only the Irish can inject into a beautiful melody and lyric. The guys (having lived in Brooklyn for the last three years) have had a musical rebirth, working with producer Chris Kuffner (Ingrid Michaelson, Bess Rogers). They have developed their sonic landscape to produce an album that indicates a true breaking of the The Guggenheim Grotto mold. While retaining the sensibilities that made The Guggenheim Grotto so successful, Storyman takes it to a much edgier, bigger, and beautiful place.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

They're delivered in a tenor voice with a beautiful patina of roughness. Ari comes to Michigan with a new release, \"Shouts and Whispers,\" which his website calls \"a non-typical collection of tracks that ultimately form a cohesive narrative. With songs of sadness and resignation giving way to lucidity and catharsis, Hest's introspection and intelligence are on display, creating moments of magic within his poetic, spare lyrics and backing them up with his ear for haunting melodies.\"",

        "description":"When the sun leaves the sky, Darlene Yeager-Torre gathers flashlights, camera and tripod and ventures into the night to create luminous landscape photographs by using extremely long exposures (45 seconds to 1 hour). After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

These tunes are featured as \u201csongs of welcome\u201d in Confucian ceremonial rites. \u201cShort Impressions of the Solitary Orchids\u201d is based on one of the earliest-known guqin compositions, You Lan \u201cSolitary Orchids\u201d, originally attributed to Confucius. It depicts the great philosopher\u2019s feeling of isolation and frustration in not being able to put his wisdom and talents to use. Two original compositions by the carillonist are featured in this program. The \u201cWind Chimes\u201d is an evocation of harmony and prosperity based on a mixture of pentatonic and whole-tone scales, while the \u201cFantasy on CABEA\u201d, based on letters from the word Canberra \u2013 capital city of Australia, where the carillonist comes from \u2013 is dwelt on a trance-like repetition of the notes, C, A, B and E. To conclude the program, two folk song arrangements are presented. Both these folk songs are based on rustic and rural settings. These exude a quality of moving simplicity and tranquility.\r\n\r\nAdrian Tien PhD, QTA (Queen's Trust Achiever) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chinese Studies, National University of Singapore. His teaching and research interests include linguistics, specialising in the areas of semantics, language and culture, cross-cultural communication, language acquisition, translation and language and music. Dr. Tien is also trained as a musicologist and is a sought-after musician (pianist and carillonneur), being a prizewinner of several international music competitions.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is part of CIUM's Chinese Arts and Culture Festival from September 24 to September 27, 2014.",

A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

        "description":"Interest in new ink\u2014ink painting which combines new techniques with traditional influences\u2014is on the rise in China and internationally. This is true from both a craft perspective, as a study of methodology, and from that of museums looking to feature installations and establish collections. This trend developed as scholars of traditional ink painting, and artists who work in the medium, have been forced to confront the question of whether the form remains relevant and retains the persuasive artistic power it has traditionally held, or whether it must become more reflective of the contemporary.\r\n\r\nBefore answering this question, it is important to develop an ontological discourse on the tradition of painting in ink\u2014to determine the core essence of the form in order to understand the ways in which its elements may be combined with contemporary techniques. What are we talking about when we discuss ink painting? Ink and rice paper as materials? The blackness of ink as a color? The brush as a strange tool? In contrasting various arguments, it becomes clear that the existing discourse on ink painting, in presuming the tradition a virtue, over-evaluates its specialties and advantages in style, and in its use of material and the tools employed. There is little basis for the assumption by devotees of the form that the techniques and material used in ink painting are superior to oil and canvas. Instead, the true essence of ink painting, and its strength as a medium, comes from the spirituality of the literati ink painting tradition, in which artists produce work with the aim of reflecting the ideal values of a community, rather than to produce a physical object of value.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pan Gongkai will present his art practices in seeking alternative ways of combining the contemporary and the traditional: contemporary installation work with an ink element; a video installation presenting reflections on the aesthetic mechanics of ink painting; and practices developed from the sense of self-discipline which evolved with the tradition. Only the last should be considered new ink, though the first two make for interesting contemporary work.\r\n\r\nA renowned artist, theoretician and educator, Pan Gongkai is a strong proponent of the Chinese ink painting tradition. His large ink paintings retain essential elements of traditional literati painting enhanced with modern aesthetics. In this way, his work exemplifies a modern synthesis of traditional ink and wash painting. Critically acclaimed, Pan\u2019s ink paintings and installations works have been exhibited at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, Venice Biennale, ZKM in Germany and major art museums in New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macao. He is the author of History of Painting in China, Limit and Exploration, Analysis of Pan Tianshou\u2019s Painting Skill and On Pan Tianshou\u2019s Life and Art. In recent years, Pan has dedicated himself to comprehensive research on modern Chinese art, and his recent publication The Road of Chinese Modern Art has made a significant impact on the liberal arts in China. Pan currently serves as the president of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.",

        "description":"Tjaarda (B.Arch.\u201958) is one of the world\u2019s most innovative and distinguished designers. A legend in European automotive design circles, he is best known for his imaginative, exciting sports cars of the 1970s and 80s that include production, prototype, custom, modification, and show cars. Of particular note are the Fiat Spyder, later versions of Mustangs, and his signature car, the Pantera. The Pantera (\u201971-\u201978) built in Italy by DiTomaso and distributed in the U.S. by Lincoln-Mercury, is a two-seater, dynamic car with powerful, direct steering aimed at the sports car driver of moderate means and is collected by car enthusiasts everywhere. An example of the \u201971 Pantera, generously lent by a local collector, will be included in the exhibition. The exhibition will run in Taubman College\u2019s Liberty Gallery, September 5-28, 2014.\r\nWhile being primarily interested in the design aesthetics of cars, he has also designed industrial and domestic objects such as typewriters, dialysis machines, and motor scooters. The exhibition will feature all aspects of his design work through photo-panels of his most important designs, design drawings, related videos, and a timeline of his career.\r\nA reception at the Taubman College Liberty Gallery will be held on Thursday, September 25, 6 \u2013 9 p.m. Tjaarda will deliver a lecture after receiving his award on Friday, September 26 at 6:00 p.m. in the Chesborough Auditorium. The talk will chronicle his life and work, with particular emphasis on the function of his design studio and its work with manufacturers. Both events are free and open to the public.",

These tunes are featured as \u201csongs of welcome\u201d in Confucian ceremonial rites. \u201cShort Impressions of the Solitary Orchids\u201d is based on one of the earliest-known guqin compositions, You Lan \u201cSolitary Orchids\u201d, originally attributed to Confucius. It depicts the great philosopher\u2019s feeling of isolation and frustration in not being able to put his wisdom and talents to use. Two original compositions by the carillonist are featured in this program. The \u201cWind Chimes\u201d is an evocation of harmony and prosperity based on a mixture of pentatonic and whole-tone scales, while the \u201cFantasy on CABEA\u201d, based on letters from the word Canberra \u2013 capital city of Australia, where the carillonist comes from \u2013 is dwelt on a trance-like repetition of the notes, C, A, B and E. To conclude the program, two folk song arrangements are presented. Both these folk songs are based on rustic and rural settings. These exude a quality of moving simplicity and tranquility.\r\n\r\nAdrian Tien PhD, QTA (Queen's Trust Achiever) is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chinese Studies, National University of Singapore.

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

It is as if the viewer has stopped by the trail and is quietly contemplating the patterns of light and color in the woods. The porcelains are functional, making enjoying them even more rewarding. Kendall has a Master's degree in Fine Art from Illinois State University and was director of the Art School, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts for many years. His studio, Oak Leaf Pottery, is in the country near Plainwell, Michigan. Kendall's work has been exhibited widely and is in collections in the US and abroad.",

A close analysis of these translations suggests that much of what we learned in our Western Civilization textbooks was more fantasy than fact. Such basic concepts as the distinction between public and private, or equality before the law, appear to have been incomprehensible to European and English writers before the mid-eighteenth century. This lecture explains the method of translingual analysis and reviews some of its more interesting results.\r\n\r\nMartin Powers is Sally Michelson Davidson Professor of Chinese Arts and Cultures at the University of Michigan, and former Director of the Center for Chinese Studies. In 1993 his Art and Political Expression in Early China, Yale University Press, received the Levenson Prize for the best book in pre-twentieth century Chinese Studies. His Pattern and Person: Ornament, Society, and Self in Classical China, was published by Harvard University Press East Asian Series in 2006 and was awarded the Levenson Prize for 2008. In 2009 he was resident at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton writing a book on the role of \"China\" in the cultural politics of the English Enlightenment. Together with Dr. Katherine Tsiang, he is co-editing the Blackwell Companion to Chinese Art.",

        "description":"On September 30, the 2014 Wallenberg Medal is being awarded to Agnes Heller, a distinguished philosopher and Holocaust survivor who seeks to understand the nature of ethics and morality in the modern world, and the social and political systems and institutions within which evil can flourish.\r\n\r\nLike Wallenberg, Professor Heller has demonstrated that courage is the highest expression of civic spirit. She has been witness to regimes that have organized murder, crushed dissent and persecuted independent voices. In 1944, as a young woman surviving in Budapest, she knew the name Wallenberg. She spoke out vigorously for autonomy and self-determination after the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Following the defeat of the 1968 Prague Spring, she went into exile and became the Hannah Arendt Visiting Professor of Philosophy in the Graduate Studies Program of The New School in New York. She is a highly influential scholar who publishes internationally-acclaimed work on ethics, aesthetics, modernity, and political theory. In 2010, she was awarded Germany\u2019s Goethe Medal. Since retirement, Agnes Heller has returned to Budapest. She remains fully engaged in public life, speaking out against the neo-nationalist and anti-Semitic strains again current in Hungary.\r\n\r\nShe will be awarded the medal and will present the Wallenberg Lecture on September 30, 2014 at 7:30 at the Rackham Graduate School.  \r\n\r\nA 1935 graduate of the University of Michigan College of Architecture, Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews near the end of World War II, and subsequently vanished into the Soviet Gulag.  The Wallenberg Medal is an award given in his memory and honor. \r\n\r\nFor more information regarding programs at U-M that honor Raoul Wallenberg including the Wallenberg lecture, Wallenberg Fellows and Summer Travel Award recipients, please visit our website at Wallenberg.umich.edu.",

        "description":"The eminent sinologist Bernhard Karlgren (1918) observed an unusual property of Chinese: Many Chinese words seem quite redundant, such as kan-jian \u2018(look)-see\u2019, xie-zi \u2018write-(words)\u2019, hui-dao \u2018return-(reach)\u2019, and yan-lei \u2018(eye)-tear\u2019. The reason, he suggests, is that Chinese has too few syllables and too many homophones, and disyllabic words can avoid ambiguity. This view is accepted widely, both East and West, but with little evidence. This lecture will show that, despite its plausibility, the orthodox is wrong. \r\n\r\nSan Duanmu is Professor of Linguistics at the University of Michigan. He received his PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 1990 and has held teaching posts at Fudan University, Shanghai (1981-1986) and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1991-present). His research focuses on general properties of language, especially those in phonology. He is the author of The phonology of Standard Chinese (2nd edition, Oxford 2007) and Syllable structure: the limits of variation (Oxford 2008).",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

Fiery violin dances with rumba-flamenco guitar while a funk bass lays down unstoppable grooves. Acoustic strings meet with electronic wizardry to create layers and depth of sound, while world rhythms excite audiences to their feet with the irresistible need to dance.\r\n\r\nSince their formation only 5 years ago, Sultans of String have been riding a wave of success, hitting #1 on world\/international music charts in Canada, and a triple Canadian Folk Music Award nomination, winning Instrumental Group of the Year. They also took home 1st place in the International Songwriting Competition out of 15,000 entries! The band has been recorded live for broadcast on BBC Television, SiriusXM in Washington DC, CTV\u2019s CanadaAM, CBC\u2019s Canada Live, and has topped campus\/community radio charts in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Belarus, Colombia, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, The Netherlands, U.S. and U.K.\r\n\r\nA Canadian string super-group, Sultans of String includes 6-string violinist and 2x JUNO Award nominee Chris McKhool \u2013 who has guest starred with Jesse Cook and Pavlo. McKhool\u2019s unbridled passion for exploring rhythms and melodies has led him to the far corners of the world, and he incorporates instruments and styles from far and wide into his music. \r\n\r\nTouring as a duo to quintet, McKhool draws from a collective of master musicians, bringing their unique blend of Global music to audiences around the world including Celtic Connections Festival in the U.K., Birdland Jazz Club in NYC, Canada\u2019s National Arts Centre, and Folk Alliance in Memphis, TN. Sultans of String have also performed on larger stages with Symphony Orchestras with noted conductor Maestro John Morris Russell (Cincinnati Pops), and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

        "description":"Ypsilanti songwriter Matt Jones, similar to how Colin Meloy of the Decemberists and William Elliott Whitmore do it, brings about a historic tone in his writing, exploring the things that we can't get away from, the sins of the past, those things and decisions that were made that are going to be paid for as long as there are people and time to pay. He is able to take songs that are as powerful and moving played solo or fully orchestrated and present them in a manner whose time somehow seems blindingly urgent and yet drawn from decades past. On his debut solo release EP \"Right to Arms\" (2005), Matt set the tone for all future releases with his darkly playful instrumentation and brutally honest lyricism. His second album, 2009's \"The Black Path,\" received critical acclaim throughout the U.S. Midwest and East Coast. Shifting worlds between richly ornamented acoustic arrangements and driven electric works, the next release, \"Half Poison, Half Pure\" (2012), was an indie rock adventure backed by Matt's newly acquired band The Reconstruction. Matt comes to The Ark with a new release, \"The Bountymen,\" featuring longtime collaborators Misty Lyn Bergeron (vocals), Colette Alexander (cello), and Serge van der Voo (double bass).",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

He's a champion yodeler, a wit to match the standup world's best, a guitarist with a unique style (a southpaw, he plays a right-handed guitar upside down), and a musician with a gift for instantly memorable tunes that are liable to turn into singalongs at any time. Says Nanci Griffith (for whom Staines's \"Roseville Fair\" has been a longtime staple): \"Bill Staines has been my hero since 1977. He carries on where Woody left off\u2013carrying on the tradition of stories and characters you wish you knew.\" \r\n",

He started out in the folk clubs of New York and Boston before going on to a long career that's encompassed both music and acting. He has given birth to over 20 albums (as well as fathering some very successful musical offspring), written folk classics including \"Dead Skunk\" and \"The Man Who Couldn't Cry,\" and created music for film and theater. The \"Boardwalk Empire\" soundtrack, including LW3 music, just won a Grammy. LLoudon\u2019s most recent project is his one-man play entitled \"Surviving Twin,\" which the singer-songwriter calls a \"posthumous collaboration\" with his writer father.\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"The art of Primitive Americana comes naturally to Sandra Somers who was born and raised in a small midwestern town \"full of large old houses, horse barns and lush farmland within roller skating range.\" Her primitive art, created using acrylics, depicts an active, bustling world with interesting architecture that time has somehow overlooked. Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

It has special significance and ramifications for early medieval Chinese literary history in light of the fluid boundaries of textual traditions and the dynamic interactions among diverse, expanding repertoires of literary and cultural meanings. It is within this context of a growing body of literary sources and an interconnectedness of not only different intellectual repertoires (e.g. Confucian, Lao-Zhuang, and Buddhist) but also different branches of learning (e.g. philosophy, poetry) that my lecture will examine how writers best made use of diverse, heterogeneous sources suited to their needs.\r\n\r\nWendy Swartz is Associate Professor of Chinese Literature at Rutgers University. She has also taught at Columbia University and the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her research is primarily on early medieval Chinese poetry, poetics, and literary criticism. She is the author of Reading Tao Yuanming: Shifting Paradigms of Historical Reception (427-1900) (Harvard University Asia Center, 2008), the principal editor of Early Medieval China: A Sourcebook (Columbia University Press, 2014), and has published numerous articles on early medieval literature in leading American journals.",

She\u2019s got the old soul singer-songwriter essence that calls upon Todd Rundgren, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, The Carpenters, and Elton John, and sonically gravitates towards the darker stylings of Nick Cave, Tom Waits, P.J. Harvey, and Danny Elfman. Rachael's fall tour strips her work down to a more intimate show\u2013expect strings. She\u2019s toured with the above as well as The Swell Season, Ray LaMontagne, Ryan Adams, Sara Bareilles, Adam Cohen, opened for David Gray solo at Madison Square Garden, been the guest of Pete Townsend\u2019s In the Attic Series, and shared the stage at Carnegie Hall with R.E.M. and Patti Smith. Rachael has played for President Obama and performed this year at the Cherry Blossom Festival with The First Lady as well as been the guest of the White House for a tweet dialogue on behalf of her fans with the White House Office of Public Engagement. Rachael sighs that most think her songs are only about love relationships and expect her to be depressed and lovelorn. At heart, she is the eternal optimist writing about connection and hope.\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

She thinks of the men she\u2019s loved and lost, vanished in the haze of existence. Hands visually portray the main characters with a beautifully engaging sensual presence, moving around miniature sets with absolute precision while a camera crew projects the finger ballet on a large screen. In this blend of film, dance, text, and theater, the audience witnesses a film screened and simultaneously made in front of their eyes. A unique event told with tender and poignant eloquence, Kiss & Cry is an unforgettable experience. \u201cAbsorbing, delightful, and ravishingly beautiful.\u201d\u009d (Boston Globe)\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this Kiss & Cry performance. Just 15 minutes long, each Tune In will offer interesting information and provocative questions for thinking about, listening to, and watching the performance. The Renegade series celebrates artistic innovation, experimentation, and discovery. Location and speaker to be announced.\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\n90 minutes, no intermission",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

She thinks of the men she\u2019s loved and lost, vanished in the haze of existence. Hands visually portray the main characters with a beautifully engaging sensual presence, moving around miniature sets with absolute precision while a camera crew projects the finger ballet on a large screen. In this blend of film, dance, text, and theater, the audience witnesses a film screened and simultaneously made in front of their eyes. A unique event told with tender and poignant eloquence, Kiss & Cry is an unforgettable experience. \u201cAbsorbing, delightful, and ravishingly beautiful.\u201d\u009d (Boston Globe)\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this Kiss & Cry performance. Just 15 minutes long, each Tune In will offer interesting information and provocative questions for thinking about, listening to, and watching the performance. The Renegade series celebrates artistic innovation, experimentation, and discovery. Location and speaker to be announced.\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\n90 minutes, no intermission",

Shawn was born in Texas, lived for a decade in Italy, and now works as a firefighter and EMT in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, where he remains very much creatively active and issues new music from his home studio. Bruce Eder of the All Music Guide calls him \"one of most fascinating and enigmatic musicians to come out of the early '70s singer-songwriter boom,\" and even if you can't fit him into any other category, he definitely belongs in the one labeled Musicians to See When You Have the Chance.\r\n",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

She thinks of the men she\u2019s loved and lost, vanished in the haze of existence. Hands visually portray the main characters with a beautifully engaging sensual presence, moving around miniature sets with absolute precision while a camera crew projects the finger ballet on a large screen. In this blend of film, dance, text, and theater, the audience witnesses a film screened and simultaneously made in front of their eyes. A unique event told with tender and poignant eloquence, Kiss & Cry is an unforgettable experience. \u201cAbsorbing, delightful, and ravishingly beautiful.\u201d\u009d (Boston Globe)\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this Kiss & Cry performance.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

When Wynton Marsalis selected the then-unknown singer to perform a residency with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, people took notice. Now, just a few years later, NPR Music has hailed him as \u201cthe next great male jazz singer.\u201d\u009d A disarmingly sincere performer with a groove that never quits, the Blue Note recording artist is that rare jazz vocalist with true star power, combining the big heart of a gospel shouter with the honeyed tone of a crooner. His album Liquid Spirit, which has gospel, blues, and R&B influences, was recently awarded the 2014 Grammy Award for \u201cBest Vocal Jazz Album.\u201d",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The two MacArthur Fellows have collaborated on several critically acclaimed projects, including the Grammy-winning Goat Rodeo Sessions, a 2008 recording of original compositions, and more recently, Chris Thile\u2019s 2013 solo recording of Bach sonatas and partitas.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

If Django Reinhardt, the cast of Stomp and the Beatles all had a party at Tim Burton's house, Caravan of Thieves would be the band they hired! Like many families, this one started with a married couple\u2013Fuzz and Carrie Sangiovanni, (guitar, vocals, various percussive \u201cinstruments\u201d\u009d) writing and performing as a duo. \u201cIt started as a romantic, bohemian vision of a couple making music, performing on the road, in parks, venues, traveling around and avoiding responsibility as much as possible,\u201d\u009d says Fuzz. \u201cThe first thing we discovered was we loved singing together, harmonizing our voices. Just seemed to click right away.\u201d\u009d In the spring of 2008, Fuzz and Carrie extended their family to include fiery violinist Ben Dean and double bass madman Brian Anderson. After that, the four of them ran away from home and never looked back. Caravan of Thieves is on tour in support of a new single, \"Dead Wrong,\" which channels pop bliss through their trademark lock-tight, turn-of-the-century, bang-out-a-beat-on-anything-that-can-take-it approach.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

I will discuss some of the ways that Buddhist relics have been used by modern political regimes to evoke patriotic sentiments at home and to establish diplomatic and economic alliances abroad.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Brose is Assistant Professor of Chinese Buddhism in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Michigan. His work has examined the social history of medieval Chinese Buddhism, particularly the history of Chan during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. Professor Brose was recently awarded a Fulbright senior scholar fellowship and a Chiang-ching Kuo junior scholar grant to pursue new research on modern representations of the famous Tang dynasty monk, pilgrim, and scholar Xuanzang. For the 2013-14 academic year, he was a visiting scholar at the Institute of Modern History, Academia Sinica in Taipei.",

Having no prior experience in assessing \u201cjihadists,\u201d\u009d Welner consulted with Danish psychologist Nicolai Sennels. Well known in Europe for his racist views of Muslims, Sennels believes that \u201cmassive inbreeding within the Muslim culture during the last 1,400 years may have done catastrophic damage to their gene pool.\u201d\u009d  Muslims are genetically unable to integrate into European society and they possess an in born capacity to be violent. As I have shown in Casting Out, this biological view of Muslim degeneracy has gained currency in European and North American courts and parliaments, often in as openly racist a form as in Sennels\u2019 opinions, but also disguised as moderate arguments about Muslim cultural incapacity to integrate. Such arguments have all been central tot he case about Muslim men who are violent towards Muslim women. In this paper I consider how law\u2019s contemporary preoccupation with the Muslim psyche renders all Muslims as less than human. I explore the logic of this eviction both from law and from humanity and discuss the relationship between a biological view of Muslim degeneracy and the culturalization of violence.\r\n\r\nSherene Razack is a full professor in the Department of Social Justice Education, at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Then the speaker will present a snapshot of the major theatrical centers in mainland China, in Beijing and Shanghai, how they have embraced Western forms, and yet how each city differs in approach. There will also be a look at the theatre of Hong Kong, which is very much a hybrid of East meets West.\r\n\r\nTo aid our understanding, we can explore how the theatre being produced in the East is (and is not) comparable to Broadway, Off-Broadway and the fringe theatre of the West. We will then examine the barriers and opportunities for creating work in China, from cultural contexts to issues of translation, as well as the potential to be able to bring exciting, canonical, modern Chinese plays to the West.\r\n\r\nTheatre director Jonathan Man, of Hong Kong Chinese descent and born & bred in the U.K., has been working on projects in China and Hong Kong the past three years, and will be sharing his creative journey. He has directed a variety of shows on different scales, including \u201cMonkey!\u201d - based on the classic novel \u201cJourney to the West\u201d, and \"wAve\" - a Korean American re-imagining of the \"Medea\" myth. He is the first British director to have been programmed for the Beijing International Fringe Festival, and he has worked on two Shakespeare productions in Shanghai.\r\n\r\nHe is now looking to create ambitious theatre productions in the U.K. and the U.S. to platform the Chinese contemporary canon, as well as developing innovative theatre for audiences in China & Hong Kong. His work draws from the East and the West, and his cultural background has allowed him to gain a unique insight into the Chinese theatrical landscape.",

        "description":"The art of Primitive Americana comes naturally to Sandra Somers who was born and raised in a small midwestern town \"full of large old houses, horse barns and lush farmland within roller skating range.\" Her primitive art, created using acrylics, depicts an active, bustling world with interesting architecture that time has somehow overlooked. Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Along the way they scored hit singles at both AAA and Hot AC Radio with \"Life Less Ordinary\" and \"The Boxer,\" placed first in the International Songwriting Competition, won an American Music Award, and recorded the music for Universal's \"Curious George II\" soundtrack. Says the Washington Examiner: \"Some call Carbon Leaf's music Southern, others label it Celtic, and still others say it leans toward bluegrass or some combination of formats. No matter what your take on the band's sound, almost everyone can agree that Carbon Leaf creates music that just isn't heard anywhere else\u2013and that's what keeps fans clamoring for more music.\" As Carbon Leaf enters their third decade of recording and touring, the band\u2019s rigorous path of independence continues, focusing on writing, producing and releasing new material directly to their fans. They come to Michigan with a new album, \"Constellation Prize.\"\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

She has shown her work in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Waterloo, Ontario, and Lenox and North Adams, Massachusetts. Her essays on literature and art have appeared in Bookslut, Caravan and The Sunday Guardian (New Delhi).\r\n\r\nRockwell grew up in a family of artists in western Massachusetts, some whose work adorns the surfaces of chinaware and brightens up the waiting rooms of dentists\u2019 offices, and others whose artistic output has found more select audiences. From 1992-2006, Lapata made a detour into Academia, from which she emerged with a PhD in South Asian literature, a book on the Hindi author Upendranath Ashk and a mild case of depression.\r\n\r\nRockwell has written The Little Book of Terror, a volume of paintings and essays on the Global War on Terror (Foxhead Books, 2012), and her collection of translations of stories by Ashk, Hats and Doctors, was published in 2013 by Penguin India. Her novel Taste was published by Foxhead Books in December 2013.\r\n\r\nCosponsored by the Department of Comparative Literature.",

A dysfunctional family of six bursts into a rehearsal of another Pirandello play with a curious claim: they are characters who have been abandoned by their author and are seeking someone to complete their story. The theater manager is intrigued and agrees to help, but becomes vexed by the interplay of the real actors with the unrealized characters, whose literary limbo causes fiction and reality to overlap. The production is directed by Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota and performed by Th\u00e9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Ville, which gave an outstanding performance of Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoc\u00e9ros two seasons ago.\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\nContains adult situations.

They have produced a dozen albums and three songbooks of their original and hilarious, quirky, yet oddly profound music, and they've toured the U.S. and Canada to rave reviews. Lou and Peter Berryman songs are being sung around the world, by a legion of professional musicians including Garrison Keillor, as well as shower singers everywhere. The pair began their musical partnership in high school in Appleton, Wisconsin, and their friendship survived a brief marriage before maturing into a durable creative collaboration.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

A dysfunctional family of six bursts into a rehearsal of another Pirandello play with a curious claim: they are characters who have been abandoned by their author and are seeking someone to complete their story. The theater manager is intrigued and agrees to help, but becomes vexed by the interplay of the real actors with the unrealized characters, whose literary limbo causes fiction and reality to overlap. The production is directed by Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota and performed by Th\u00e9\u00c3\u00a2tre de la Ville, which gave an outstanding performance of Ionesco\u2019s Rhinoc\u00e9ros two seasons ago.\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\nContains adult situations.

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"This lecture considers two major museum exhibits devoted to Jews, one organized in the Soviet Union on the eve of World War II, and the other established in 2012 in the Russian Federation. The first, the state-funded 1939 exhibit \u201cThe Jews in Tsarist Russia and in the USSR\u201d\u009d was organized by the Jewish Section of the State Museum of Ethnography in Leningrad, and remained on permanent display to the Soviet public until the Nazi invasion in 1941. The second, the Jewish Museum and Center for Toleration in Moscow, is reportedly the largest Jewish museum in the world. Its construction cost an estimated $50 million, with donations from Russian oligarchs and Vladimir Putin himself. Though conceived in radically different political circumstances, each of these exhibits conveys a significant message about the place of Jews in Soviet and post-Soviet society. Why did the Stalinist regime subsidize a special exhibit devoted to Jews on the eve of World War II, and why did it never reopen this exhibit after 1945? In contrast, why has a new and lavishly-funded museum devoted to the history of the Jews now opened in Putin\u2019s Russia? What motivates a powerful state \u2013 one Soviet, one post-Soviet \u2013 to put Jews \u201con display\u201d\u009d?",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Kristina Kleutghen, Assistant Professor of Art History and Archaeology, Washington University\r\n\r\nAt the eighteenth-century Chinese court, an unprecedented type of monumental illusionistic painting seemed at first glance to be real spaces occupied by real figures and objects. Produced collaboratively by the best Chinese and Western painters serving the High Qing emperors, these works mounted on walls and ceilings blended native and foreign techniques in works of confounding perspectival deceptiveness, which were nonetheless deeply significant to their patron. Originally widely installed inside various imperial spaces in and around Beijing, today only a few survive, held almost exclusively inside restricted areas of the Forbidden City. In addition to offering new insights into late imperial China\u2019s most influential rulers, these little-known paintings provide a new perspective on how Chinese art integrated and rejected foreign concepts during the height of early modern Sino-European exchange.\r\n\r\nKristina Kleutghen is Assistant Professor of Art History and Archaeology at Washington University in St. Louis. She earned her Ph.D. in the History of Art and Architecture from Harvard University in 2010. Focusing on Chinese art of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), her research investigates the imperial court, optical devices, foreign contact, and connections to science and mathematics. Recent articles have appeared in Archives of Asian Art and Eighteenth-Century Studies, and recent research has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Getty Research Institute. Her first book, Imperial Illusions: Crossing Pictorial Boundaries in the Qing Palaces, is forthcoming January 2015 with University of Washington Press.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Having released a series of timeless records since the early 1970s, Chris' newest release, Still On the Levee (release date: July 22, 2014), is a career-spanning retrospective double CD. Recorded in New Orleans with studio-mates he calls The Motivators, Still On the Levee plays host to special guests including Allen Toussaint and Loudon Wainwright III. The record highlights the vast catalog of an American music master. Reviewers and fans from around the world agree that Chris is a profound songwriter, a blistering guitarist and, as he puts it, a 'one-man band to the bone.' Chris melds the styles of his two major influences, Lightnin' Hopkins and Mississippi John Hurt, into his own signature guitar sound. His music continues to draw deeply from the blues, American folk music, modern poets and humanist philosophers. He may be best known for writing \"Love You Like A Man\" which Bonnie Raitt and, more recently, jazz great Diana Krall have covered. His music has been covered by numerous artists and featured in soundtrack albums, independent film, television and commercials.\r\n",

Inspired by the mathematical notions of quantum mechanics, Ikeda employs a spectacular combination of synchronized video screens, real-time content feeds, digital sound sculptures, and for the first time in Ikeda\u2019s work, human performers. Ikeda poetically harnesses the simplest elements of all data and explodes them outward into the infinite potential of science and art. His immersive and viscerally exciting music plunges into the grey space between 0 and 1, true and false, where uncertainty and probability coexist, through a powerful display of technology and art designed to take the spectator inside the indescribable structures at the very foundation of all life. \u201cA sound and music event that is simultaneously extraordinarily, mesmerically beautiful, and also so radically disorienting that afterwards you feel as if the world has tilted to one side.\u201d\u009d (TheArtsDesk.com)\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this superposition performance.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Julien Labro (of Hot Club of Detroit) forms a unique collaboration with Chicago\u2019s contemporary classical Spektral Quartet, presenting rarely performed works on the bandone\u00c3\u00b3n and accordina (sister instruments of the accordion) by Villa-Lobos, Piazzolla, and Nuevo Tango composer Diego Schissi.

Inspired by the mathematical notions of quantum mechanics, Ikeda employs a spectacular combination of synchronized video screens, real-time content feeds, digital sound sculptures, and for the first time in Ikeda\u2019s work, human performers. Ikeda poetically harnesses the simplest elements of all data and explodes them outward into the infinite potential of science and art. His immersive and viscerally exciting music plunges into the grey space between 0 and 1, true and false, where uncertainty and probability coexist, through a powerful display of technology and art designed to take the spectator inside the indescribable structures at the very foundation of all life. \u201cA sound and music event that is simultaneously extraordinarily, mesmerically beautiful, and also so radically disorienting that afterwards you feel as if the world has tilted to one side.\u201d\u009d (TheArtsDesk.com)\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this superposition performance.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Hovannisian, professor emeritus of history, University of California, Los Angeles\r\n\r\nSeptember, 2012 marked the 90th anniversary of the Smyrna Catastrophe when much of the city, the second largest in the Ottoman Empire, was destroyed by fire four days after the Turkish army had occupied the city. The calamity, a part of the final phase of the Armenian Genocide, marked the end of a strong Christian presence in the historic Aegean coastal regions and turned hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Armenians into refugees. In this illustrated lecture, Prof. Richard Hovannisian will discuss the important role of Smyrna (Izmir) in modern Armenian history and the inferno that engulfed the city in September 1922.\r\n\r\nProfessor Richard G. Hovannisian is the first holder of the Armenian Educational Foundation Chair in Modern Armenian History at UCLA, and Professor Emeritus, Department of History, UCLA. He currently serves as Distinguished Chancellor\u2019s Fellow at Chapman University in Orange County. He is the author of numerous books including the four-volume history The Republic of Armenia. He is the editor of Armenian Smyrna\/Izmir, the eleventh volume of proceedings from the UCLA conference series \u201cHistoric Armenian Cities and Provinces.\u201d He also traveled to Izmir and environs in June 2012 as the historian-guide for an Armenian Heritage Tour led by Armen Aroyan.",

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others.

        "description":"Speaker: Aminda Smith, Associate Professor of History, Michigan State University\r\n\r\nIn the early 1950s, numerous eyewitness reports, in multiple languages, began describing the efforts of the Chinese Communists to transform the minds of ordinary people, from workers in Shanghai factories to POWs in Korean camps. Called \u201cthought reform\u201d (\u601d\u60f3\u6539\u9020 sixiang gaizao) in China and \u201cbrainwashing\u201d in the U.S., the reeducation project may or may not have turned individuals into communists. There is no doubt, however, that the project, as envisioned by its orchestrators and their critics, led many people, in China and elsewhere, to radically rethink the nature and potential violability of their innermost thoughts. This talk uses formerly classified and newly available archival materials on the reeducation project as it was carried out in multiple places \u2013 institutions for the lumpen proletariat, prisons for intellectuals, and POW camps \u2013 to delve into what this project meant to those who participated in it, as reeducators and reeducatees.\r\n\r\nAminda Smith is Associate Professor of History at Michigan State University. The author of Thought Reform and the Dangerous Classes: Reeducation, Resistance, and the People (Rowman and Littlefield, 2013), she has a particular interest in the social and cultural history of Chinese communism. She is also co-founder and advisory board member for The PRC History Group (prchistory.org), which fosters collaboration and primary-source sharing within a global network of scholars interested in the history of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"During the Mao era, cultural workers in communities all over the People\u2019s Republic of China created political exhibitions. These exhibitions were part of a larger effort to rewrite local experience, and the local landscape, in the universal language of Chinese Marxism and in the artistic style of socialist realism. Local exhibitions were one concrete form of cultural work that used tangible local detail\u2014local speech, local diet, local forms of agriculture or industrial production\u2014to show that local lives and local experiences conformed to the truths of Marxism, and to the universal history of the Chinese nation.\r\n\r\nIn Gejiu, a tin-mining town in southern Yunnan, cultural workers in the 1970s created an Exhibition on the History of Class Struggle in the Gejiu Tin Mines and a Recollect Bitterness Center. These joint exhibitions became the premier \u201cclassrooms\u201d for class education in Yunnan province, instructing as many as a thousand visitors a day. During the 1950s, cultural workers in Gejiu had authenticated the local truth of Chinese Marxist history by displaying personal stories of capitalist exploitation, rags worn by miners in the inhumane \u201cold society,\u201d and drawings of worker uprisings. The exhibitions they created during the Cultural Revolution added historical reenactment as a new technique of political instruction. Historical reenactment primarily took the form of yiku (\u201crecollecting bitterness\u201d), narratives about oppression and liberation recited by the elderly. The practice of yiku invoked the older, powerful practice of suku (\u201cventing grievances\u201d), a method of class struggle during the land reforms of the 1940s and 1950s. Written renditions and live performances of yiku featured prominently in class education exhibitions, amplified by artwork and the display of pre-liberation artifacts. This historical reenactment enjoined visitors to \u201clearn through experience\u201d (tihui) the exploitation, oppression, revolt, and liberation of the Chinese proletariat. The Recollect Bitterness Center even recreated the very time and space of the narrated events. Crawling through an old mine shaft and emerging upright into the light, visitors to the Center performed the metaphorical choreography of emancipation and its structure of historical memory. This instilment of perceptual knowledge about the nature of classes and the meaning of proletarian revolution produced an embodied understanding of Chinese Marxist history, interpolated new political subjects, and incited socialist construction. \r\n\r\nLara Kusnetzky is a lecturer in the Department of Classical and Modern Languages, Literatures, and Cultures at Wayne State University.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Apollo\u2019s Fire \u2013 whose past two appearances have been in Hill Auditorium \u2013 brings seven vocal soloists, the renowned professional chamber choir Apollo\u2019s Singers, and an orchestra of gleaming period instruments to the intimacy of St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this Apollo\u2019s Fire performance. Just 15 minutes long, each Tune In will offer interesting information and provocative questions for thinking about, listening to, and watching the performance. The Renegade series celebrates artistic innovation, experimentation, and discovery. Location and speaker to be announced.",

        "description":"As the name of the constitutional reform that inaugurated South Korea\u2019s Fourth Republic (1972-79), Yushin has become synonymous with the second half of the Park Chung Hee era when extreme political repression was coupled with total mobilization of society under the double imperatives of modernization and development. Existing scholarship on the period has focused on its political and economic dimensions, and given rise to such influential concepts as \u201cdevelopmental dictatorship\u201d\u009d (kaebal tokchae) and \u201cmass dictatorship\u201d\u009d (taejung tokchae).\r\n\r\nMoving beyond the era\u2019s political economy, the conference on \u201cCultures of Yushin\u201d\u009d seeks to explore the remarkably rich and varied cultural production of the Yushin period in its dynamic, and often ambivalent, relationship to state power. Cultural production is broadly conceived to include literature, film, television, theater, music, art, architecture, animation, comics, advertising, fashion, and sports. We welcome innovative research that complicates familiar terms of opposition between coercion and consent, collaboration and resistance, and high art and popular culture.\r\n\r\n\u201cCultures of Yushin\u201d\u009d is the fourth annual conference on contemporary Korea sponsored by the Academy of Korean Studies and the Nam Center for Korean Studies at the University of Michigan. Previous conferences in the series have examined the phenomenon of Hallyu in the age of social media, transgressive practices in Korean society, and the politics of sports. Kicking off a two-day event devoted to the decade of the 1970s, the conference will be followed by an international workshop on the legacies of major public intellectuals of the 1970s, including Ham Sok-hon, Paik Nak-chung, Ri Yong-hui, Kang Man-gil, Shin Il-yong, and An Pyong-mu. The workshop will be led by historians, literary critics, and sociologists from the United States, Japan, and Korea.\r\n\r\nPapers presented at \u201cCultures of Yushin\u201d\u009d conference will be considered for inclusion in a peer-reviewed, edited volume of the same title to be published by the University of Michigan Press, as part of Perspectives on Contemporary Korea series. Selected participants will be asked to submit complete papers by September 30, 2014.\r\n\r\nConference organizers: Youngju Ryu and Nojin Kwak (University of Michigan)",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

An Enter the Haggis live show is a musical feast\u2013dynamic and emotionally uplifting. Alternating between upbeat rock numbers with sing-along choruses and slower, more introspective alt pop songs, the band plays progressive and lyrically driven music that\u2019s strongly rooted in Celtic tradition\u2013from the storytelling to the bagpipes. \r\n",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

The group makes its mark everywhere they play, with their musicianship, communicative energy, and innovative approach to the distinctive music of their home region. All of Visht\u00e8n's youthful members are multi-instrumentalists, arrangers and composers, and their energetic rhythms (you have never heard the feet used as percussion in quite this way) have brought them very excited audiences all over Canada and in the U.S., France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, and Switzerland. \r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Deng Xiaoping was an extraordinary leader who set China on its current path, including opening, economic growth, and tight control over ideas.\r\n\r\nEzra F. Vogel is the Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard. After graduating from Ohio Wesleyan in 1950 and serving two years in the U.S. Army, he studied sociology in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard, receiving his Ph.D. in 1958. He then went to Japan for two years to study the Japanese language and conduct research interviews with middle-class families. From 1961-1964 he was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard, studying Chinese language and history. He remained at Harvard, becoming lecturer in 1964 and, in 1967, professor. He retired from teaching in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, at the invitation of the Guangdong Provincial Government, he spent eight months studying the economic and social progress as it pioneered economic reform beginning in 1978. The results are reported in One Step Ahead in China: Guangdong Under Reform (1989). His Reischauer Lectures were published as The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia (1991). The Chinese edition of his book on Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China (Harvard U Press 2011) sold over 700,000 copies the first year after publication in China. He has visited East Asia every summer since 1958 and has spent a total of over six years in Asia. He lectures frequently in Asia, in both Chinese and Japanese.",

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

        "description":"Each of the works in Suspended Moments: Photographs from the David S. Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Anne has been a folk-music insitution for more than three decades now with her soaring, crystal-clear soprano and her innovative original songs. She came of age as part of Chicago's folk scene, and she has never stopped experimenting and searching: among her many collaborations are those with jazz musicians and with theatrical presenters. Anne's latest album, \"The Things I Notice Now,\" is a tribute to Tom Paxton, who in turn has said, \"Anne Hills is such an exquisite singer that it\u2019s understandable that people might be swept up in the pure beauty of her voice and thereby overlook her writing. That would be a mistake. For me, Anne\u2019s writing, in songs like \u201d\u02dcFollow That Road\u2019 and many others, is as direct, melodic and deep as any work being done today.\"\r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

He engages with theorizations of modernity, contemporaneity, and postcoloniality to analyze the modern and contemporary art of Asia, the Middle East, and their diasporas. Another research interest is his study of media, crafts, and popular culture with reference to ongoing socio-aesthetic transformations in South Asia, seeking to understand how emergent urban publics forge new avenues of civic participation. Dadi\u2019s curatorial projects and his work as a practicing artist have further served to enrich his academic scholarship.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will address key methodological issues in the analysis of Urdu cinema during its formative decades. These include changes that ensued with the introduction of the talkies, the relationship of \"Urdu\" cinema to \"Hindi\" cinema, the imbrication of cinema with the literary world, the relays between Lahore and Bombay studios and personnel, and transformations in wake of the 1947 Partition and Independence of India and Pakistan.\r\n\r\nCo-sponsored by the Department of History of Art, the Islamic Studies Program, and Screen Arts & Cultures.",

Sports\u2014as intramural and intercollegiate activities for students, as a segment of the entertainment industry within American society, as cultural objects of intense popular interest and media coverage, and as research subjects for faculty and students in a varied and expanding range of disciplines, whether at major public research institutions or small, private liberal arts colleges\u2014are indisputably a central aspect of the landscape of American higher education. The value of sport in the university context, however, is not beyond dispute.On the contrary, as sports play an ever greater role in higher education and in American society, debates have arisen, on the pages of daily newspapers and specialized academic journals, about their role and the costs and benefits they carry\u2014from financial to educational, physical to cultural to moral. These questions, furthermore, intersect in complex ways with broader social issues related to gender, race, and sexual orientation, and the symposium will seek to shed light on the ways in which approaches to and assessments of the question of value change when these factors are taken into account.\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE\r\n\r\nFriday, November 14\r\n4:00pm\r\nLecture by Amy Perko, Executive Director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics\r\n5:00pm\r\nLecture by Taylor Branch, historian and author of numerous books and articles, including \"The Shame of College Sports,\" \"Why Scholarships Don't Count as Payment for College Athletes,\" and \"Why I Can't Get Excited About the NCAA's New Reforms\"\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 15\r\n10:30am: Economics\r\nRodney Fort, Lawrence Kahn, Stephen A.

Sports\u2014as intramural and intercollegiate activities for students, as a segment of the entertainment industry within American society, as cultural objects of intense popular interest and media coverage, and as research subjects for faculty and students in a varied and expanding range of disciplines, whether at major public research institutions or small, private liberal arts colleges\u2014are indisputably a central aspect of the landscape of American higher education. The value of sport in the university context, however, is not beyond dispute.On the contrary, as sports play an ever greater role in higher education and in American society, debates have arisen, on the pages of daily newspapers and specialized academic journals, about their role and the costs and benefits they carry\u2014from financial to educational, physical to cultural to moral. These questions, furthermore, intersect in complex ways with broader social issues related to gender, race, and sexual orientation, and the symposium will seek to shed light on the ways in which approaches to and assessments of the question of value change when these factors are taken into account.\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE\r\n\r\nFriday, November 14\r\n4:00pm\r\nLecture by Amy Perko, Executive Director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics\r\n5:00pm\r\nLecture by Taylor Branch, historian and author of numerous books and articles, including \"The Shame of College Sports,\" \"Why Scholarships Don't Count as Payment for College Athletes,\" and \"Why I Can't Get Excited About the NCAA's New Reforms\"\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 15\r\n10:30am: Economics\r\nRodney Fort, Lawrence Kahn, Stephen A.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"From his early years touring with Sarah Vaughan to founding smooth jazz supergroup Fourplay, U-M alumnus Bob James has explored a vast stretch of musical territory. A leading force in 1970s crossover jazz, the keyboardist, composer, and producer played an essential role on a series of hit records and has also had a profound effect on hip-hop, with his songs among the most sampled in hip-hop history. James\u2019s most recent album, Quartette Humaine, was recorded a month after Dave Brubeck\u2019s death and pays tribute to the iconic pianist. He is assembling a quintet to celebrate this longawaited homecoming, with concert materials drawn from James\u2019s extensive songbook, including tunes from his CTI Records catalog and Dave Brubeck compositions.\u201cFor many of his fans, Bob James is to jazz what James Brown is to R&B \u2013 the music and the musician go hand in hand.\u201d\u009d (NPR Music) A UMS debut.",

You can call her songs folk music if you like, but there\u2019s jazz there too, and some sultry blues. She's a real triple threat who combines a unique slide guitar sound with some extremely seductive vocals and fresh original songs that tie everything together into a real, honest whole. Says Andy Friedman of the New Yorker of Natalia's multiple talents: \"Natalia's voice could send an orchid into bloom while her guitar playing can open a beer bottle with its teeth.\" Natalia comes to Michigan with a new release, \"Come Thief, Come Fire,\" of which she says, \"I started making this record ... back in July, 2013 when I took some new songs to my good friend, collaborator, and producer Willy Porter, thinking we were making an EP of songs recorded live in the studio. ... But one of the songs, \u201cWhat Comes After,\u201d\u009d felt like it wasn\u2019t done. So I sent the song out to my good friends AG and Meg Toohey in Los Angeles and the little folk ditty became an explosion of sound. Then AG and I went out to the desert ... and we made a video of the song ... and suddenly, there was a story unfolding. I realized that all the songs were centered around fire\u2013its power to destroy, to resurrect, to light and ignite.\"",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

His concerts are one-of-a-kind events in which amazing guitar chops and songwriting merge into a single unit. Porter's acoustic guitar skills have drawn comparisons with those of Leo Kottke, who drew the young Willy Porterinto music the first time he heard the \"6 & 12 String Guitar\" album. He continues to stretch each show by incorporating performance art, live audio looping, and improvisational sketch comedy. Each tour date becomes a unique event, a musical experience much greater than just a review of past, present and future recorded work. \r\n",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Speaker: Yang Zhong, Professor of Political Science, University of Tennessee; Distinguished Changjiang Scholar, School of International and Public Affairs, Shanghai Jiaotong University\r\n\r\nStreet protests have become commonplace in China. Utilizing extensive survey data, this study attempts to shed light on the nature of environmental street protests in China. The key question to be answered in this talk is why, facing the same issue, some people choose the option of participating in street protests while others do not? Our multivariate analytical findings indicate that our urban residents' willingness to participate in street protest over a hypothetical pollution issue in China is significantly related to their attitudes toward institutions in China. What motivates people to participate in street protests has a lot to do with their trust and support of the political system in China and their perceived government transparency. In other words, these protests are not just what Lewis Coser calls \"realistic conflicts\" which primarily involve specific issues and solutions. One implication from our study is that street protests in China may not be as benign and non-regime threatening as some scholars think.\r\n\r\nDr. Yang Zhong is a Distinguished Changjiang Scholar at the School of International and Public Affairs in Shanghai Jiaotong University and tenured Professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. His main research and teaching interests include Chinese political culture and participation and Chinese local government. He has published over 30 scholarly articles and book chapters, authored two books and co-edited several books. His articles have appeared in journals such as Comparative Political Studies, the Journal of Politics, Political Research Quarterly, Asian Survey, Communist and Post-Communist Studies, Journal of Contemporary China, and PS: Political Science and Politics. His latest book is Political Culture and Participation in Rural China. Dr. Zhong has served in a number of academic and administrative positions. He was Associate Head of the Department of Political Science, Director of Asian Studies, Director of the Tennessee in China Initiative, and Director of the Center for International Education, all at the University of Tennessee.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Shimabukuro became internationally famous when his video of George Harrison\u2019s \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps\u201d\u009d was posted on YouTube without his knowledge and became one of the first viral videos on the site.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"This talk investigates several plays in the Ming court repertoire on the demons Erlang and Nezha, and explores how sensations of sound, smell, and sight define natural communities of demons that are place specific, and how these same perceptual sensations signal the crossing of boundaries that are meant to segregate demons and grant them territorial autonomy. The processes of quelling of these aggressive demons have a historical lineage in folk myth and local cults, and the plays reflect the ways in which the Chinese state controlled local cults by incorporating them into state-sanctioned religious ritual, and appropriating their local power for state interests. \r\n\r\nStephen West is a Foundation Professor of Chinese at Arizona State University and professor emeritus in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Berkeley. His original research interests are in Chinese performance literature and cultural history of the 11th-14th century. While these may not seem particularly \u201cglobal\u201d in nature, in fact many of the features considered to be marks of modernity appear in Chinese society at this time as features of a society undergoing rapid urbanization, an explosion of print media, and a rapid change in the nature of its governing class. His work has centered on texts from popular culture.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

Dance music from Russian ballet and Chinese opera are set in opposition to the introspection of Kristin Kuster\u2019s contemplative work. Michael Gandolfi\u2019s music meditates on and dances to an anonymously composed Renaissance melody known as Spagnoletta. Ingolf Dahl\u2019s composition, cast as a short symphony, marches, sings, and dances in what has become a masterwork of wind repertoire. The music of Tur\u00edna illustrates each of these descriptive elements in a single work!    Pre-concert lecture with composer Kristin Kuster and Michael Haithcock at 7:15 in the Lower Lobby.    PROGRAM: Turina - La Processi\u00f3n del Rocio; Kuster - Interiors; Gandolfi - Meditations and Flourishes on a Renaissance Theme; Yi - \u201cEnergetically\u201d from Dragon Rhyme; Dahl - Sinfonietta; Tchaikovsky - \u201cDance of the Jesters\u201d from The Snow Maiden.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Los Lobos were already East L.A. neighborhood legends, Sunset Strip regulars and a Grammy Award\u2013winning band (Best Mexican-American\/Tejano Music Performance) by the time they recorded their major label debut H\"ow Will The Wolf Survive?\" in 1984. Although the album\u2019s name and title song were inspired by a National Geographic article about real life wolves in the wild, the band\u2013David Hidalgo, Louie Perez, Cesar Rosas, Conrad Lozano and Steve Berlin\u2013saw parallels with their struggle to gain mainstream rock success while maintaining their Mexican roots. Perez, the band\u2019s drummer, once called their powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues and traditional Spanish and Mexican music \u201cthe soundtrack of the barrio.\u201d\u009d",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. Somers is presently living and working in a 1860s farmhouse homestead with restored outbuildings, including a chicken coop used as a showroom studio.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times.

His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice.

The focus of this group will be on the transition of retirement and the challenges that come with it -- from questions like \"How will I define myself?\" to \u201cHow will I establish priorities and spend my time?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis series will help you plan for the non-financial aspects of retirement, such as redefining who are you, exploring new interests and opportunities, and maintaining social connections. You will also learn about what researchers find makes for a fulfilling retirement.\r\n\r\nYou must register for the entire series, as each session is sequenced to provide an optimal experience.

It describes the different periods of library developments, from ancient libraries to modern libraries, and from private\/non-public access libraries to freely accessible modern public and academic libraries. With the rapid economic growth, many libraries have been built up with digital access, special collections and special services in recent years. Some of them are worth visiting either for research or leisure purposes while visiting China.\r\n\r\nDr. Mengxiong Liu received her Ph.D. in Library and Information Studies from the University of Michigan in 1990.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

        "description":"This colloquium seeks to reorient modern Jewish history by looking at the Ottoman capital, Constantinople, as the central stage upon which Jewish and imperial affiliations collided and coalesced. The nineteenth century decline of the Ottoman, Habsburg, and Russian empires and the spread of Western European imperialist intentions propelled the migrations of Jews of different imperial and national subjecthoods to and through Constantinople. This colloquium will explore how these flows of Jewish movement tested Jewish cohesion while forcing the renegotiation of carefully established relationships between Jews and the empires of which they were subjects. In focusing particularly on questions of commerce, human trafficking, and Zionism, this talk will explore what happens when Jewish programs clash with imperial concerns, when inter-subethnic Jewish tensions threaten to destablize the fragile balance between Jews and empire, and the ways in which subethnic Jewish identities are reinforced through imperial allegiance. \r\n\r\nDevi Mays is an assistant professor of Judaic Studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and Fellow at the Frankel Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies. After receiving her Ph.D. in Jewish History in 2013, she was awarded a Postdoctoral Fellowship in Modern Jewish Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary. Her research interests include the modern Sephardic diaspora, the Jewish Mediterranean, transnational networks and migration, and how minority groups navigate transitions from empire to nationalizing states. She is currently revising a book manuscript, tentatively entitled Forging Ties, Forging Passports: Migration and the Modern Sephardi Diaspora, which traces the itineraries and connections of Sephardic migrants from the Ottoman Empire and its successor states to and through Mexico and beyond as a lens into the transnational Sephardic familial, commercial, and patronage networks that created a transoceanic modern Sephardic diaspora. Her publications include, among others, \u201c\u2018I Killed Her Because I Loved Her Too Much\u2019: Gender and Violence in the 20th-Century Sephardi Diaspora\u201d (Mashriq & Mahjar: Journal of Middle East Migration Studies, 2014), and numerous translations from Ladino, Spanish, and French in Sephardi Lives: A Documentary History, 1700-1950 (Stanford University Press, 2014). She is also working on her second project, which explores the Ottoman capital of Constantinople as a central stage upon which Jewish subethnic and imperial affiliations collided and coalesced.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

In a true community tradition, the performance features the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra, the 175 voices of the Grammy Award-winning UMS Choral Union (2006 \u201cBest Choral Performance\u201d), conductor Jerry Blackstone, and two U-M alumni as soloists \u2014 Janai Brugger and David Daniels.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

Recognized immediately from its famous, galloping overture, William Tell dramatizes the life of the Swiss folk hero whose expert marksmanship with a crossbow is the stuff of legends. This concert version introduces four operatic soloists to local audiences alongside the 200-member orchestra and chorus of the Royal Theatre of Turin, one of the most important opera houses in Italy. \r\n\r\nFeaturing\r\nFabio Maria Capitanucci, baritone     William Tell\r\nAngela Meade, soprano\t              Matilde\r\nJohn Osborn, tenor\t              Arnold Melcthal\r\nAleksandr Vinogradov, bass\t      Gualtiero",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times.

His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice.

The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L.

Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times.

Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L.

Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition\u2014featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood\u2014includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer. In addition to Rosen\u2019s own photographs of young adults and children, the exhibition also features the works of other photographers known for their images of childhood, including Sally Mann, Dawoud Bey, and Helen Levitt, among others. The exhibition, organized in tribute to Rosen as an educator and artist, also examines the doctor\u2019s vision as a collector, in works by landscape and still life photographers such as Ansel Adams, Michael Kenna, Howard Bond, and Billie Mercer.    \r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the University of Michigan Health System.",

It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice.

The Chicago-based ensemble delivers provocative and mind-bending performances, combining bracing virtuosity with an alluring sense of irreverence. The ensemble\u2019s performances sparkle with wit and pound with physical energy, inhabiting and exploring the sound world of new music with comfort, conviction, and infectious enthusiasm. \u201cThe blackbirds are examples of a new breed of super-musicians. They perform the bulk of their new music from memory. They have no need for a conductor, no matter how complex the rhythms or balances\u2026 [They are] stage animals, often in motion, enacting their scores as they play them.\u201d (Los Angeles Times) Their program includes two works by composers who made their mark in indie band circles: Bryce Dessner of The National and Richard Reed Perry from Arcade Fire.\r\n\r\nTune In with UMS for a brief pre-performance talk before select Renegade series performances, including this eighth blackbird performance. Just 15 minutes long, each Tune In will offer interesting information and provocative questions for thinking about, listening to, and watching the performance. The Renegade series celebrates artistic innovation, experimentation, and discovery. Location and speaker to be announced.",

It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice.

The visually arresting Henri Michaux: Mouvements features dancers dressed in black costumes on a white floor to create a choreographic version of India ink drawings and poetry by Belgian poet and artist Henri Michaux. The company also performs Gymnop\u00e9dies, a ballet created around the theme of the duet. The 11 dancers, who worked daily with a piano teacher during the creation of the work, each take their places at a piano to play Erik Satie\u2019s intriguing piano works of the same name. In both of these works, Chouinard \u201ctravels to the very depths of our collective psyche and brings what she finds there out into the open for all to see.\u201d (bachtrack.com)\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\nPerformance contains nudity and adult situations.",

        "description":"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper\u2019s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli\u2018s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space.\r\n\r\nTomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works \u201cfreeze time,\u201d trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future.\r\n\r\nThe Times grew from Tomaselli\u2019s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his \u201cnews junkie\u201d habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images.\r\n\r\nLead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design.",

He has made many superb recordings for ECM Records since the mid-1970s, when he was at the forefront of the free jazz scene. For most of the past decade, he has been ranked among the world\u2019s top jazz trumpeters and composers. Sta\u0144ko will present his great, first project for ECM Records, Balladyna, based on the Polish tragedy by Juliusz S\u0142owacki that was published in 1839. As part of his visit, the 71-year-old will give the 2015 Copernicus lecture, an annual lecture at U-M that highlights the rich variety of Polish intellectual and cultural life.",

She is the author of Poetry of Kings (Oxford, 2011), a book about Mughal-period literary culture. She has published numerous articles on the literary and intellectual life of seventeenth-century sub-imperial courts. Culture and Circulation, an edited volume (with Dr. Thomas de Bruijn of Leiden, the Netherlands) that explores literary history from a multilingual point of view, has recently come out from Brill. Her current research is on local histories from the Mughal-period that were recorded in classical Hindi dialects such as Brajbhasha and Rajasthani. She is also the recent recipient of an ACLS collaborative grant and is co-authoring a book on aesthetic worlds of the Indian heroine with art historian Molly Aitken.",

From his New Orleans beginnings and fiery debut with legendary drummer Art Blakey\u2019s Jazz Messengers to his current role as artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, he inspires and uplifts people through superb musicmaking. Since 1988, Marsalis has led the 15-piece Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, which simultaneously honors the rich heritage of Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong while presenting a stunning variety of new works from illustrious names, many of whom perform regularly with the ensemble. From swinging to supple, sophisticated to spirited, it\u2019s all sheer jazz perfection \u2014 it\u2019s no wonder these annual appearances have become a favorite of UMS audiences.",

Dr. Alan Rosen examines these intriguing questions in the context of the Holocaust when Jews in ghettos, camps, and in hiding were compelled to develop innovative strategies to track time, maintain continuity with the past, and envision a future.\r\n\r\nAvraham (Alan) Rosen is the author or editor of ten books. He is most recently the author of The Wonder of Their Voices: The 1946 Holocaust Interviews of David Boder (Oxford UP, 2010; updated paper edition 2012), and Sounds of Defiance: The Holocaust, Multilingualism and the Problem of English (U of Nebraska P, paper 2008); the collaborator on a German edition of I Did Not Interview the Dead, by David Boder (Winter Verlag, 2011); and the editor of Elie Wiesel: Jewish, Literary, and Moral Perspectives (Indiana UP, 2013, finalist, National Jewish Book Awards) and Literature of the Holocaust (Cambridge UP, 2013). \r\nHe was a research fellow of the Fondation pour la M\u00e9moire de la Shoah from 2006-2009. He has also held fellowships at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum; the International Institute for Holocaust Research, Yad Vashem; the Katz Center for Advanced Jewish Studies, University of Pennsylvania, and the Archives for the History of American Psychology, University of Akron. He recently served as the Wilkenfeld Scholar in Holocaust Education in Sydney, Australia. He has taught at universities and colleges in Israel and the United States, and lectures regularly on Holocaust Literature at Yad Vashem\u2019s International School for Holocaust Studies and other Holocaust study centers. Born and raised in Los Angeles, educated in Boston under the direction of Elie Wiesel, he lives in Jerusalem with his wife and four children. His current book projects include a monograph  entitled, \u201cKilling Time, Saving Time: Calendars and the Holocaust.\u201d His article, \u201cTracking Jewish Time in Auschwitz,\u201d is scheduled to appear in fall, 2014 in Yad Vashem Studies.",

He presented it as a spiritual declaration that his musical devotion had become intertwined with his religious faith. The Campbell Brothers, whose unique sacred steel gospel music was created in African-American churches, revisit the work on their signature slide guitars to mark the anniversary, paying particular attention to its transcendent spiritual message. \u201cThe Campbells create a unique, steel-guitar-driven gospel music that\u2019s every bit as earth-shattering as [Robert] Johnson\u2019s music was in the \u201930s. It\u2019s a soul-stirring blend of gospel and the power and volume of electric blues and rock, a sound as hot as brimstone that kicks holy butt.\u201d (NPR)",

Urbanism imprinted itself upon Jewish political, cultural, economic, and spiritual life, just as Jews imprinted themselves on city space.  What happened, then, to cities and to Jews, when Jews joined the droves of Americans who left urban space after World War II?  Drawing from her extensive research on Detroit, Lila Corwin Berman suggests that contrary to the history of white flight, the story of Jewish migration away from cities is not one of urban disinvestment.  As Jews moved away from cities, they remained invested, even if ambivalently, in urban life.  American Jews\u2019 enduring urbanism reflected their historical entanglement with modern urban formation.  In recent years, Jews have returned to city spaces once considered inhospitable to Jewish life, helping to set in motion new political and economic structures that are remaking urban life as we know it.",

Close engagement with disparate intellectual traditions, which often disagree on issues of epistemology and politics, has been a source of creative tension. Gidwani\u2019s approach to theory and praxis reflects this. Although he studies issues of work, poverty, livelihoods, and agroecological change within the Indian context, his scholarship is defined by research problematics rather than by regional affiliation. He draws liberally on Africanist, Latin American, and Southeast Asian scholarship for insights.",

Dance Magazine has described his work as \u201celastic and electric, luxuriantly rippling, poetically arranged with moments of perfect stillness that arrive amid splashes of expression. His choreography wriggles energy through the body, stretches it, suspends it, and then unleashes it.\u201d His latest work, which will be performed over two different programs, is inspired by the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and civil rights movements in South Africa and the United States. The music includes Max Roach\u2019s epic 1960 jazz work \u201cWe Insist! (Freedom Now Suite)\u201d as well as new music written by jazz pianist Robert Glasper and songs by Otis Redding.",

The company\u2019s work explores Abraham\u2019s diverse training in classical music, visual art, and a multitude of dance forms ranging from ballet to hip-hop. Dance Magazine has described his work as \u201celastic and electric, luxuriantly rippling, poetically arranged with moments of perfect stillness that arrive amid splashes of expression. His choreography wriggles energy through the body, stretches it, suspends it, and then unleashes it.\u201d His latest work, which will be performed over two different programs, is inspired by the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and civil rights movements in South Africa and the United States. The music includes Max Roach\u2019s epic 1960 jazz work \u201cWe Insist! (Freedom Now Suite)\u201d as well as new music written by jazz pianist Robert Glasper and songs by Otis Redding.",

It will seek to demonstrate how, in both high and vernacular German-Jewish culture, a portrait was drawn of both Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews that promoted an image of the former as authentic, desirable, beautiful, and worthy of emulation while the culture and physical appearance of Ashkenazic Jewry was most frequently considered regrettable and in need of radical correction.  The paper argues that the turn to Sephardic idealization that began in the eighteenth century was based on a firm foundation of German-Jewish self abnegation and was a constitutive element of the fashioning of a new form of Ashkenazic identity, one that signaled the end of a pan-Ashkenazic Jewish cultural sphere and metamorphosed instead into two distinct realms of Ashkenazic expression and experience\u2014German and Eastern European.",

Formed in 1958 from a group of leading London musicians, and working without a conductor, the Academy gave its first performance in its namesake church in November 1959. Today, the Academy performs some 100 concerts around the world each year, with as many as 15 tours each season. Pianist Jeremy Denk joins the ensemble for two piano concertos by J.S. Bach, bookended by works for string orchestra by Igor Stravinsky.",

While in college studying business administration, Gil heard singer and guitarist Jo\u00e3o Gilberto on the radio and was immediately smitten; he bought a guitar and learned to play and sing bossa nova. An original founder of the Tropic\u00e1lia movement in Brazil in the late 1960s who was exiled to London for his revolutionary role in conflating the seemingly threatening lyrics of US and European rock music with Brazilian musical traditions, Gil is today recognized as a pioneer of world music. From musical revolutionary to international pop star to beloved statesman, Brazil\u2019s former Minister of Culture returns to Ann Arbor with his romantic homage to the father of bossa nova.\r\n\r\nPerformance note:\r\nThis concert will be primarily performed in Gilberto Gil\u2019s native Brazilian Portuguese.",

        "description":"Dashing, dapper, and debonair, Max Raabe might have walked straight out of the Golden Age of Berlin in the 1920s. With his elegant poise, suave sophistication, and silky-smooth baritone, he brings to life the songs and style of a bygone age. Born into a family of farmers just as the Beatles were serving their apprenticeship in the bars and clubs of Hamburg, Raabe\u2019s childhood musical tastes were formed by his discovery of a weekly program of 1920s music on German radio. His passion was further roused by a record he found in his parents\u2019 cupboard, a humorous instrumental called \u201cI\u2019m Crazy About Hilda.\u201d Before long, he was collecting 78s in flea markets and junk shops, and by age 16 was an expert on the songs and styles of the Weimar era. Raabe\u2019s deadpan humor and charmingly meticulous re-creations of the standards as they used to be sung \u2014 in formal evening wear with an orchestra \u2014 is guaranteed to take the audience away from their everyday problems and into another world. The time has never been better to discover \u2014 or rediscover \u2014 timeless tunes by legends like Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, and Fred Astaire.",

Hancock is a true icon of modern music, and there are few artists in the music industry who have had more influence on acoustic and electric jazz and R&B.\r\n\r\nA DownBeat Hall of Famer and NEA Jazz Master, Chick Corea is at the vanguard of improvised music, both as a leading pianist forging new ground with his acoustic jazz bands and as an innovative electric keyboardist. He has attained living legend status after five decades of unparalleled creativity and an artistic output that is simply staggering.\r\n\r\nTheir musical relationship dates back to 1968, when Corea replaced Hancock in the piano chair of the Miles Davis band. In 1978, they toured together as an acoustic piano duo, which surprised the music world at the peak of the jazz-rock fusion era. Both of them released double albums drawn from those live tour performances (part of one album was recorded in Hill Auditorium). The two haven\u2019t recorded together since, but they have reunited for acclaimed duo appearances and join forces for an evening that is sure to be one of the most memorable of the 2014-2015 season.",

Now the ensemble returns with a more conventional string quartet program that features works by Dvo\u00c5\u2122\u00c3\u00a1k, Latvian composer Peteris Vasks, and Tchaikovsky. The Berlin-based ensemble was founded in 1989 and programs its own series at the Berlin Philharmonic. In 2011, it was named Quartet in Residence at the Vienna Konzerthaus, a position it holds alongside the Belcea Quartet.",
