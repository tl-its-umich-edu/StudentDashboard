# This file documents the application instance specific configuration files which vary when running the application in different
# clusters.  E.g. It lists the application files required to make this installation run as, say, a dev server rather
# than a production server. The files referenced are provided in the configuration file tar proviced in the build artifacts.
#
# The process for Security files is separate and not covered here.

# To find out the mapping for a specific configuration just grep for the configuration name.
#  e.g. grep -i 'QA' configuration.mapping

# The format for each line is:
# [CONFIGURATION_NAME] EXPECTED_NAME PHYSICAL_NAME
# Example>>>> [DEMO] $HOME/config/greatApp.properties ./config/greatAppDemo.properties
# For the DEMO instance, the application will look for the greatApp.properties file and the installation
# process will make sure reading that file gets the contents of the ./config/greatAppDemo.properties file.
# That assurance can be arranged by copying / renaming / linking files as AWI finds convenent.
