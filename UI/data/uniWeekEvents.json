Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

Pulling from a wealth of vivid, melancholic subject matter, her songs are cathartic and poetically rich works that stand boldly on their own, but when accompanied by her quartet, the Big Beautiful, realize new potential. She writes of her childhood struggles and the ensuing trials and tribulations encountered while working toward a greater purpose in life. While her music also celebrates the simple joy of being alive, there is always a common thread of nostalgia for things that are lost and those that are fading. What kind of music is it? The question seems almost irrelevant in Misty Lyn's unique world, but she told a French interviewer that \"someone once called [me] 'gothic country' and I liked the sound of it.\" ",

He paints. He had his first singing gig at age three. He comes from Tupelo, Mississippi and absorbed the power of gospel music just like another famous native of that town. And he ties it all together in original songs, masterpieces of gutbucket storytelling country and soul with a fearless confessional streak (and often very funny). Thom Jurek of the All Music Guide calls Paul Thorn \"a soul singer who can slip down into the murk and mess of human emotions with style and aplomb.\" ",

        "description":"Using tones and leaf patterns of deep forests, Tom Kendall studies deep northern woodlands with close-up still life compositions. It is as if the viewer has stopped by the trail and is quietly contemplating the patterns of light and color in the woods. The porcelains are functional, making enjoying them even more rewarding. Kendall has a Master's degree in Fine Art from Illinois State University and was director of the Art School, Kalamazoo Institute of Arts for many years. His studio, Oak Leaf Pottery, is in the country near Plainwell, Michigan. Kendall's work has been exhibited widely and is in collections in the US and abroad.",

Come and see crystals from the Museum of Natural History, books from the Library's collection, and displays of the equipment used at the X-Ray Crystallography Lab.\r\n\r\nUNESCO chose 2014 as the International year of Crystallography because it commemorates two important anniversaries in the study of matter: the centennial of X-ray diffraction, and the 400th anniversary of Kepler\u2019s observation in 1611 of the symmetrical form of ice crystals. Both breakthroughs led to subsequent studies in the role of symmetry in matter and the nature of crystalline material. U-M continues this investigation today.\r\n",

After a career of teaching art, with degrees from Edgecliff College and Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, she began exploring her own artistic vision. A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings. Despite the difficulty of long exposure photography, the resulting, glowing images fuel her creativity and rejuvenate her spirit.",

        "description":"A native of California, Liz Story began her musical training as a young child, mastering Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 11 by the age of 11. When her family moved to Germany during her teens, she added languages, philosophy, and poetry to her studies. On her return to the United States, Liz continued her formal piano studies at the Juilliard School of Music and also enrolled at Hunter College. After hearing the jazz pianist Bill Evans one night at the Bottom Line in New York City, she decided to learn jazz piano\u2013and after moving back to Southern California and taking a job playing piano in a restaurant, she was suddenly thrust into improvisations when she discovered that the piano she was to perform on had no stand for her sheet music. Over several months, these improvisations developed into compositions. When Will Ackerman, founder of the influential Windham Hill label, heard a tape of those, he signed her to record her 1983 debut album \u201cSolid Colors.\" Liz has since released a dozen albums that havehighlighted her classical piano background, fused with a wide range of styles embracing jazz, folk, pop, and impressionistic music. An evening with Liz Story is meditative, spiritual, even profound, and we're excited to welcome her back to The Ark for the first time in many years.",

A presentation on night photography piqued her curiosity about that genre and sent her on the adventures that now fill her evenings.

Nationally recognized museums, historic townships and individual collectors have commissioned her work, including the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village.

This five-piece ensemble comes from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Moving from bluesy riffs to tango-inflected jazz, to a raunchy New Orleans jamboree vibe, their music always returns to a wonderfully bouncy traditional sound. They themselves call their music \"trad on anabolic steroids.\" With a repertoire of fresh self-penned tunes and inventive arrangements, Beoga's album \"A Lovely Madness\" earned a 9\/10 rating from Ireland\u2019s Hot Press magazine, and all their albums have landed on numerous ten-best lists in both Ireland and North America. Says the Irish Echo: \"It is Beoga who may be Ireland\u2019s closest answer to The Band in combined virtuosity, risk-taking, and omnivorous musical palate.\"",
