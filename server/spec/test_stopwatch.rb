##### Demonstrate approach to testing methods in a module by constructing a tiny class
##### to contain the module.  Two different methods are shown here.
#require 'rubygems'
require 'minitest'
require 'minitest/autorun'
require 'minitest/unit'
# require 'webmock/minitest'
require_relative '../stopwatch'
require_relative '../Logging'

  # down fixture information.
