## This file maps from an "application" name to information
## required to use the WSO2 ESB at Michigan.  The "application_name"
## maps to the application name created for the relevant APIs in
## the WSO2 API store and the other values are available from there.
## There can be multiple application blocks below as each instance of the studentdashboard.yml
## file provides a specific application name to indentify which information to use.

## StudentDashboard uses the WAPI Ruby module and these values are passed through to that.

## ALWAYS MODIFY A COPY OF THE TEMPLATE FILE AND NEVER CHECK IN THAT COPY.
## NOTE: INDENTATION MATTERS.

## The StudentDashboard application uses the WAPI Ruby module to access APIs implemented via the WSO2 ESB to get data.
## The ESB requires security information and that information needs to be supplied in the following format.
## Much of the information maps to information provided by the WSO2 api store.

## Information for many applications can be specified in the same file.  The name of the application
## that will be used for a particular instance of the StudentDashboard is specified in the studentdashboard.yml file.

#The information format is:
#your_application_name:
# token_server: apple
# api_prefix: steve
# key: baseball
# secret: practice
# token: optional

### WSO2 ties security credentials to "applications" created in it's API directory store.
### The application name used here is the one selected for use by this instance of this program.
### The token server URL is used to renew expired tokens.  Typically this is the same for
### all applications using the same ESB.
### WAPI will prefix each request it makes with this string.  The string can be anything you
### wish to use.  This reduces duplication in the code.
### The key and secret are supplied when registering an application in the ESB.
### The ESB registration process provides a token along with the key and secret.  WAPI knows how to
### get / renew this token automatically so it does not need to be explicitly specified.
