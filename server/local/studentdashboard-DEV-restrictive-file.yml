### This yaml format file specifies configuration values that may change from
### instance to instance.  E.g. the values may need to be different between the
### developer, qa, and production instances.
### NOTE: White space indentation matters for yaml and tabs are not permitted.


##### Values below here are unlikely to change except when
##### testing.
# Text to use when the server gets a non-standard request.

invalid_query_text: Come on, ask something reasonable

# The name to use when no user name is available.  This is primarily useful
# in test installations.

anonymous_user: anonymous

#### Default term to use for course lookups if no other information is available.
default_term: 2010

############ authentication ##############
# These values allow implementation of a stub authentication service (to be used
# primarily for load testing).
# The authn_uniqname_override, when set to 'true' will allow the uniqname of the user
# may be taken from the URL UNIQNAME parameter rather than
# using the authenticated user.  E.g. localhost:3000/?UNIQNAME=bono with run StudentDashboard
# as if the user is bono.

# The two "authn_wait_..." values give the range of time to wait between changing
# the user name and returning.  They are included so that the effect of a delay
# that would be caused by using an external authentication system can be
# modeled during load testing.

authn_uniqname_override: false
authn_wait_min: 0.01
authn_wait_max: 0.03

## The latte_admin_group specifies the name of a MCommunity group.  Members
## of that group will have administrative tools for Latte.  In particular they will
## be able to request information for people besides themselves.

## The members of the group are read on startup and it will require a restart to
## make changes effective.

latte_admin_group: TL-Latte-admin-test

######### Data provider selection ###########
## Two data provider implementations are supplied:
## ESB - this is the default and the credentials are kept separately in the security.yml file.
## FB (file based) - This is primarily for testing and allows reading data
## from local files.  Configuration is documented below.

###### ESB data provider 
# This is the name of the ESB "application" that identifies the credentials to be used
# for ESB oauth authentication.  It must match up with a corresponding application name
# in the security.yml file.  See that file for details on the authentication information.
#application_name: SD-QA

###### FB (file based) data provider
data_provider_file_directory: server/test-files/courses
## This value is used for the optional file based data provider.
## If the value is not set then the ESB based provider is used.
## If data_file_provider_directory does have a value then Latte will treat
## the value as a directory name and will look there for files matching
## the request.  If the directory starts with
## a '/' it is taken as an absolute path.  Otherwise the base directory for
## application is prepended to the path.  For example it may look within
## the directory /usr/latte/really/good/directory or within the expanded war file.
