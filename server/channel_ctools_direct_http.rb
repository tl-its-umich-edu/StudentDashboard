###### CTools direct URL provider ################
# Query CTools direct urls.  Creates a session then automatically adds that to each request
# until the end method is called.  The session id is invisible to the user.
# Creating a new instance of the class creates a session.
# The 'app_name' specifies the configuration to use in the supplied security_file.  Configuration
# requires an admin user / pw and a url prefix that will be prefixed to the url passed into do_request.

# public methods:
# - initialize(security_file, app_name) - initialize connection based on parameters from this file.
# - do_request(url) -
# - end - close down the connection / session (currently unimplemented, not clear if appropriate)
